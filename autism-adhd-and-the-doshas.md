content: "# Introduction\n\nI was recently diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder
  Level 1 and ADHD, the inattentive\ntype. I suppose, AuDHD for short.\nThere are
  many reasons why I now have this official label of AuDHD, not that I\nwas hoping
  for it, but due to a childhood behavioral disorder diagnosis and a\ndesire to understand
  myself better, I decided to start considering that something\nin my childhood issue
  was misunderstood.\n\n!!! note \"\"\n    But what started as simply considering
  some new diagnosis turned into a\n    larger worldview shift when it comes to medicine
  and how we treat people for\n    things we label disorderly.\n\n## Personal History\n\nA
  brief history lesson for context is that I was diagnosed with bipolar\ndisorder,
  but not specifically type 1 or type 2. This diagnosis came about two\ntimes, once
  in my late childhood and again when I was 19.\nThe diagnosis never made a ton of
  sense to me, but it seemed to almost match some of\nthe things that my mom specifically
  was concerned about.\nThere is another point for later on, which is that part of
  me wanted to be bipolar.\nI felt like it would be cool, but also it made me special.\n\n!!!
  warning \"bias\"\n    There's no way that this desire didn't turn into massive confirmation
  bias\n    in getting this diagnosis as a kid and as a late teenager.\n\nOnce I started
  kind of thinking *for myself* a little bit - the bipolar diagnosis\nwas one of my
  first spiritual challenges in understanding the brokenness of\nhumanity.\n\n## The
  Challenge\n\nI believe in an orderly God, the creator of all things, who makes things
  both\nsoundly and reasonable. Mental health is complex because it's not like a broken\narm,
  throw a cast on, and wait... Taking medicine felt almost antithetical to\nmy worldview
  because I had a deep desire to see\nsomething miraculous. So, I backed myself into
  this odd worldview where I\ntaking medicine must be fighting something that God
  wants to do in me with this\nbrokenness. I felt like I was trying to do something
  maybe God didn't want me to\ndo, but was also wrestling with \"but if something's
  really wrong (which is\npossible because we live in a broken world) God gifts these
  doctors to come up\nwith this medicine to help heal some of the brokenness.\"\n\nSo
  I had these two competing ideas that were very loud in my head.\n\n!!! note \"\"\n
  \   In hindsight, an AuDHD diagnosis somewhat explains this behavior of mine.\n
  \   Wherein I wanted to be sick, and I had these competing ideas about the\n    character
  of God.\n\nSo I've been more at less at peace with the idea that behavior disorders
  are\napart of life for many people - and that medical treatment can be helpful.\n\n#
  Reflection\n\nAs I've gotten older and reflected on being bi-polar I couldn't help
  but notice\nthat hardly any part of the atypical\npieces of myself matched up with
  bi-polar at all... Around the time I started\nto notice this my wife began wondering
  if I had something more akin to ADD. We\ndidn't really understand what that meant,
  or how it has changed over the years,\nor any of it - but based on some initial
  stereotypes ADHD began to become a\ncommon thing we discussed\nAfter some more legitimate
  research we both became pretty convinced that I was\nmeasurably on the Autism Spectrum
  and that certainly there were ADHD tendencies\nthat negatively affected my life.
  I talked with my doctor and after several\npsych evaluations it turns out that my
  self-diagnosis was consistent with the\nconclusion of the evaluation. So if this
  was the end then my thought would've\nbeen \n\n!!! note \"I'm not bi-polar\"\n    ok
  I'm not bi-polar, I'm AuDHD - there's some coping mechanisms I can\n    learn now
  and things make sense.\n\nHowever, this wasn't the end for me - getting diagnosed
  with AuDHD\ndidn't/hasn't changed my life - it's given me a framework by which I
  can\nunderstand myself in the context of our\nWestern world better.\nBut there's
  a lot more here and as we look ahead, I want to be clear that I\ntake no special
  pride in the AuDHD label...\nI'll talk about myself with this label as a way of
  communicating with people who\nunderstand it, but the main point of this post will
  be in how understanding\nmyself as a human being more holistically led to a different
  point of view of\nwhat the West calls neurodivergencies.\n\n# Treatment\n\nI have
  been taking a light mood stabilizer for a while now per my former\nbi-polar diagnosis.
  There's no doubt that it is coincidentally a helpful tool\nin coping with some debilitating
  aspects of AuDHD but the more I reflect the\nmore I want to get away from it - personally.\n\nI'm
  not sure what to think about treatment overall... I recognize that some folks are\nmuch
  more negatively affected by the tendencies we label as neurodivergent and\nthat
  there are meaningful changes that can come from modern western medicine.\nHowever,
  there's also old/ancient and natural solutions to many problems that I\nthink are
  often overlooked \n\n!!! quote \"Simple doesn't mean easy\"\n    often exercise
  and cleaner eating can treat depression and anxiety for\n    example. That doesn't
  mean the anxiety wasn't significant or legitimate, but\n    it's not like a pharmaceutical
  is the only option for treating something\n    legitimate.\n\n!!! warning \"The
  other side\"\n    I also see that obviously there are severe cases of Autism - I
  think we\n    should better understand where that comes from, and I wouldn't ever
  claim\n    that just drinking some tea and figuring out an exercise regime can cure\n
  \   something that is fully debilitating.\n\n!!! note \"Las drogas\"\n    I think
  where I have the biggest issues with \"treatment\" is that taking\n    mental health
  medication is a fad today... it doesn't mean it's not helpful,\n    but our culture
  glorifies taking drugs as long as they come from a\n    pharmaceutical company.
  I've personally come across this as I've shared my\n    struggles and official AuDHD
  diagnosis with some friends -  and it's clear that\n    some of them give these
  ads and medicines every ounce of their faith and\n    that's frankly concerning
  in its own way\n    \n## Two Systems | East v West\n\nI've become critical of the
  modern Western perspective on neurodivergence\nand mental/behavioral health. It's
  primarily that I'd be much less skeptical if\nit wasn't for all the money... I notice
  patterns as well that I don't find\ncomforting - such as the focus on symptoms and
  isolated treatment of them or\ngroups of symptoms rather than looking at a human-being
  as an entire organism or\nsystem. \nI know that certain pieces of a system can break,
  and sometimes treating\nthose isolated breakages is the way to go - but also we
  (in the West) seem to\navoid thinking about ourselves as 1 whole thing... There's
  language that\nyounger people use about their \"whole self\" but honestly I only
  see them talk\nabout sexuality as if that defined everything about a person... that's
  100% not\nwhat I have in mind here... \n\nEvery one of my psychiatric appointments
  up through the last few years had never\nsought to get me off my medication... It
  got me thinking the goal was for me to be\na customer for life. I don't like being
  reliant on anything external and the\nfact that there was never a goal for me to
  be self-sufficient in my own health\nbecame troubling.\n\nMy philosophical issues
  arising with our modern medical systems have led me\nto becoming more open to Eastern
  medicine and as I explore how those systems\nhave historically analyzed patterns
  and attributed those patterns to different\nways of thinking, I think the pattern-analysis
  and subsequent recommendations\ncan be extremely valuable. This is where adaptogens
  come in for me.\n\n## Lifestyle Changes\n\nI'd heard of Lion's Mane via some Joe
  Rogan clips (have become a bigger and\nbigger fan of him over the last few years),
  and then got a subscription to\nFourSigmatic which is a coffee company that offers
  mushroom-replacement and\nsupplements for coffee and tea basically. So I'm drinking
  coffee with Lion's\nMane, and have added a few other mushroom tinctures with Reishi
  and Chaga\nspecifically, as well as Eleuthero and Turkey Tail as a means of introducing\nadaptogens
  into my routine and maybe it's confirmation bias again, but as I've\ngone on and
  off the Lion's Mane specifically I notice a significant difference\nin my cognitive
  function... When I'm diligent about putting the Lion's Mane\ntincture into my coffee
  in the morning it is like unlocking on-demand\nhyper-focus some mornings...\n\n#
  Wrapping It Up\n\nThis post is mostly a stream-of-consciousness as I reflect on
  the atpypical\nnature of much of my life, how that fits into the modern Western
  discourse of\nmental health, and how the Western perspective might end up not being
  a helpful lens\nthrough which to process these behavioral issues.\n\nWith sufficient
  context, a faithful summary of my journey is that I don't mind being labeled as
  AuDHD - there's plenty that's helpful with it. However if an Ayuverdic Shaman \"diagnosed\"
  me as a person whose elemental make up was primarily earthy and watery with an odd
  flare of fire, and that elemental make-up is what explains some of my tendencies
  (needing to know the correct answer, tunnel-vision and hyper-focus, literal understanding
  of the world, etc.) then I want to understand that with the same amount of \"weight\"
  as being AuDHD.. \n\n!!! note \"TLDR\"\n    At the end of the day there's multiple
  ways to label people based on\n    observation - either at the micro or macro levels
  of humanity. I don't think\n    that the Western systems of medicine get everything
  right, and the Eastern\n    models have been around for thousands more years so
  I want to treat them with\n    an equal amount of respect and validity"

    for context is that I was diagnosed with bipolar\ndisorder, but not specifically
    type 1 or type 2. This diagnosis came about two\ntimes, once in my late childhood
    and again when I was 19.\nThe diagnosis never made a ton of sense to me, but it
    seemed to almost match some of\nthe things that my mom specifically was concerned
    about.\nThere is another point for later on, which is that part of me wanted to
    be bipolar.\nI felt like it would be cool, but also it made me special.</p>\n<div

    God, the creator of all things, who makes things both\nsoundly and reasonable.
    Mental health is complex because it's not like a broken\narm, throw a cast on,
    and wait... Taking medicine felt almost antithetical to\nmy worldview because
    I had a deep desire to see\nsomething miraculous. So, I backed myself into this
    odd worldview where I\ntaking medicine must be fighting something that God wants
    to do in me with this\nbrokenness. I felt like I was trying to do something maybe
    God didn't want me to\ndo, but was also wrestling with &quot;but if something's
    really wrong (which is\npossible because we live in a broken world) God gifts
    these doctors to come up\nwith this medicine to help heal some of the brokenness.&quot;</p>\n<p>So
    I had these two competing ideas that were very loud in my head.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition

    mine.\nWherein I wanted to be sick, and I had these competing ideas about the\ncharacter

    and reflected on being bi-polar I couldn't help but notice\nthat hardly any part
    of the atypical\npieces of myself matched up with bi-polar at all... Around the
    time I started\nto notice this my wife began wondering if I had something more
    akin to ADD. We\ndidn't really understand what that meant, or how it has changed
    over the years,\nor any of it - but based on some initial stereotypes ADHD began
    to become a\ncommon thing we discussed\nAfter some more legitimate research we
    both became pretty convinced that I was\nmeasurably on the Autism Spectrum and
    that certainly there were ADHD tendencies\nthat negatively affected my life. I
    talked with my doctor and after several\npsych evaluations it turns out that my
    self-diagnosis was consistent with the\nconclusion of the evaluation. So if this
    was the end then my thought would've\nbeen</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">I'm not bi-polar</p>\n<p>ok I'm not bi-polar, I'm AuDHD
    - there's some coping mechanisms I can\nlearn now and things make sense.</p>\n</div>\n<p>However,
    this wasn't the end for me - getting diagnosed with AuDHD\ndidn't/hasn't changed
    my life - it's given me a framework by which I can\nunderstand myself in the context
    of our\nWestern world better.\nBut there's a lot more here and as we look ahead,
    I want to be clear that I\ntake no special pride in the AuDHD label...\nI'll talk
    about myself with this label as a way of communicating with people who\nunderstand
    it, but the main point of this post will be in how understanding\nmyself as a
    human being more holistically led to a different point of view of\nwhat the West
    calls neurodivergencies.</p>\n<h1 id=\"treatment\">Treatment <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    light mood stabilizer for a while now per my former\nbi-polar diagnosis. There's
    no doubt that it is coincidentally a helpful tool\nin coping with some debilitating
    aspects of AuDHD but the more I reflect the\nmore I want to get away from it -
    personally.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure what to think about treatment overall... I recognize
    that some folks are\nmuch more negatively affected by the tendencies we label
    as neurodivergent and\nthat there are meaningful changes that can come from modern
    western medicine.\nHowever, there's also old/ancient and natural solutions to
    many problems that I\nthink are often overlooked</p>\n<div class=\"admonition

    exercise and cleaner eating can treat depression and anxiety for\nexample. That

    is fully debilitating.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Las

    is that taking\nmental health medication is a fad today... it doesn't mean it's
    not helpful,\nbut our culture glorifies taking drugs as long as they come from
    a\npharmaceutical company. I've personally come across this as I've shared my\nstruggles
    and official AuDHD diagnosis with some friends -  and it's clear that\nsome of

    of the modern Western perspective on neurodivergence\nand mental/behavioral health.
    It's primarily that I'd be much less skeptical if\nit wasn't for all the money...
    I notice patterns as well that I don't find\ncomforting - such as the focus on
    symptoms and isolated treatment of them or\ngroups of symptoms rather than looking
    at a human-being as an entire organism or\nsystem.\nI know that certain pieces
    of a system can break, and sometimes treating\nthose isolated breakages is the
    way to go - but also we (in the West) seem to\navoid thinking about ourselves
    as 1 whole thing... There's language that\nyounger people use about their &quot;whole
    self&quot; but honestly I only see them talk\nabout sexuality as if that defined
    everything about a person... that's 100% not\nwhat I have in mind here...</p>\n<p>Every
    one of my psychiatric appointments up through the last few years had never\nsought
    to get me off my medication... It got me thinking the goal was for me to be\na
    customer for life. I don't like being reliant on anything external and the\nfact
    that there was never a goal for me to be self-sufficient in my own health\nbecame
    troubling.</p>\n<p>My philosophical issues arising with our modern medical systems
    have led me\nto becoming more open to Eastern medicine and as I explore how those
    systems\nhave historically analyzed patterns and attributed those patterns to
    different\nways of thinking, I think the pattern-analysis and subsequent recommendations\ncan
    be extremely valuable. This is where adaptogens come in for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lifestyle-changes\">Lifestyle

    company that offers mushroom-replacement and\nsupplements for coffee and tea basically.
    So I'm drinking coffee with Lion's\nMane, and have added a few other mushroom
    tinctures with Reishi and Chaga\nspecifically, as well as Eleuthero and Turkey

    a stream-of-consciousness as I reflect on the atpypical\nnature of much of my
    life, how that fits into the modern Western discourse of\nmental health, and how
    the Western perspective might end up not being a helpful lens\nthrough which to
    process these behavioral issues.</p>\n<p>With sufficient context, a faithful summary
    of my journey is that I don't mind being labeled as AuDHD - there's plenty that's
    helpful with it. However if an Ayuverdic Shaman &quot;diagnosed&quot; me as a
    person whose elemental make up was primarily earthy and watery with an odd flare
    of fire, and that elemental make-up is what explains some of my tendencies (needing
    to know the correct answer, tunnel-vision and hyper-focus, literal understanding
    of the world, etc.) then I want to understand that with the same amount of &quot;weight&quot;
    as being AuDHD..</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">TLDR</p>\n<p>At
    the end of the day there's multiple ways to label people based on\nobservation
    - either at the micro or macro levels of humanity. I don't think\nthat the Western
    systems of medicine get everything right, and the Eastern\nmodels have been around
    for thousands more years so I want to treat them with\nan equal amount of respect

    for context is that I was diagnosed with bipolar\ndisorder, but not specifically
    type 1 or type 2. This diagnosis came about two\ntimes, once in my late childhood
    and again when I was 19.\nThe diagnosis never made a ton of sense to me, but it
    seemed to almost match some of\nthe things that my mom specifically was concerned
    about.\nThere is another point for later on, which is that part of me wanted to
    be bipolar.\nI felt like it would be cool, but also it made me special.</p>\n<div

    God, the creator of all things, who makes things both\nsoundly and reasonable.
    Mental health is complex because it's not like a broken\narm, throw a cast on,
    and wait... Taking medicine felt almost antithetical to\nmy worldview because
    I had a deep desire to see\nsomething miraculous. So, I backed myself into this
    odd worldview where I\ntaking medicine must be fighting something that God wants
    to do in me with this\nbrokenness. I felt like I was trying to do something maybe
    God didn't want me to\ndo, but was also wrestling with &quot;but if something's
    really wrong (which is\npossible because we live in a broken world) God gifts
    these doctors to come up\nwith this medicine to help heal some of the brokenness.&quot;</p>\n<p>So
    I had these two competing ideas that were very loud in my head.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition

    mine.\nWherein I wanted to be sick, and I had these competing ideas about the\ncharacter

    behavior disorders are\napart of life for many people - and that medical treatment

    and reflected on being bi-polar I couldn't help but notice\nthat hardly any part
    of the atypical\npieces of myself matched up with bi-polar at all... Around the
    time I started\nto notice this my wife began wondering if I had something more
    akin to ADD. We\ndidn't really understand what that meant, or how it has changed
    over the years,\nor any of it - but based on some initial stereotypes ADHD began
    to become a\ncommon thing we discussed\nAfter some more legitimate research we
    both became pretty convinced that I was\nmeasurably on the Autism Spectrum and
    that certainly there were ADHD tendencies\nthat negatively affected my life. I
    talked with my doctor and after several\npsych evaluations it turns out that my
    self-diagnosis was consistent with the\nconclusion of the evaluation. So if this
    was the end then my thought would've\nbeen</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">I'm not bi-polar</p>\n<p>ok I'm not bi-polar, I'm AuDHD
    - there's some coping mechanisms I can\nlearn now and things make sense.</p>\n</div>\n<p>However,
    this wasn't the end for me - getting diagnosed with AuDHD\ndidn't/hasn't changed
    my life - it's given me a framework by which I can\nunderstand myself in the context
    of our\nWestern world better.\nBut there's a lot more here and as we look ahead,
    I want to be clear that I\ntake no special pride in the AuDHD label...\nI'll talk
    about myself with this label as a way of communicating with people who\nunderstand
    it, but the main point of this post will be in how understanding\nmyself as a
    human being more holistically led to a different point of view of\nwhat the West
    calls neurodivergencies.</p>\n<h1 id=\"treatment\">Treatment <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    of the modern Western perspective on neurodivergence\nand mental/behavioral health.
    It's primarily that I'd be much less skeptical if\nit wasn't for all the money...
    I notice patterns as well that I don't find\ncomforting - such as the focus on
    symptoms and isolated treatment of them or\ngroups of symptoms rather than looking
    at a human-being as an entire organism or\nsystem.\nI know that certain pieces
    of a system can break, and sometimes treating\nthose isolated breakages is the
    way to go - but also we (in the West) seem to\navoid thinking about ourselves
    as 1 whole thing... There's language that\nyounger people use about their &quot;whole
    self&quot; but honestly I only see them talk\nabout sexuality as if that defined
    everything about a person... that's 100% not\nwhat I have in mind here...</p>\n<p>Every
    one of my psychiatric appointments up through the last few years had never\nsought
    to get me off my medication... It got me thinking the goal was for me to be\na
    customer for life. I don't like being reliant on anything external and the\nfact
    that there was never a goal for me to be self-sufficient in my own health\nbecame
    troubling.</p>\n<p>My philosophical issues arising with our modern medical systems
    have led me\nto becoming more open to Eastern medicine and as I explore how those
    systems\nhave historically analyzed patterns and attributed those patterns to
    different\nways of thinking, I think the pattern-analysis and subsequent recommendations\ncan
    be extremely valuable. This is where adaptogens come in for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lifestyle-changes\">Lifestyle

    Mane via some Joe Rogan clips (have become a bigger and\nbigger fan of him over
    the last few years), and then got a subscription to\nFourSigmatic which is a coffee
    company that offers mushroom-replacement and\nsupplements for coffee and tea basically.
    So I'm drinking coffee with Lion's\nMane, and have added a few other mushroom
    tinctures with Reishi and Chaga\nspecifically, as well as Eleuthero and Turkey
    Tail as a means of introducing\nadaptogens into my routine and maybe it's confirmation
    bias again, but as I've\ngone on and off the Lion's Mane specifically I notice
    a significant difference\nin my cognitive function... When I'm diligent about
    putting the Lion's Mane\ntincture into my coffee in the morning it is like unlocking
    on-demand\nhyper-focus some mornings...</p>\n<h1 id=\"wrapping-it-up\">Wrapping

    a stream-of-consciousness as I reflect on the atpypical\nnature of much of my
    life, how that fits into the modern Western discourse of\nmental health, and how
    the Western perspective might end up not being a helpful lens\nthrough which to
    process these behavioral issues.</p>\n<p>With sufficient context, a faithful summary
    of my journey is that I don't mind being labeled as AuDHD - there's plenty that's
    helpful with it. However if an Ayuverdic Shaman &quot;diagnosed&quot; me as a
    person whose elemental make up was primarily earthy and watery with an odd flare
    of fire, and that elemental make-up is what explains some of my tendencies (needing
    to know the correct answer, tunnel-vision and hyper-focus, literal understanding
    of the world, etc.) then I want to understand that with the same amount of &quot;weight&quot;
    as being AuDHD..</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">TLDR</p>\n<p>At
    the end of the day there's multiple ways to label people based on\nobservation
    - either at the micro or macro levels of humanity. I don't think\nthat the Western
    systems of medicine get everything right, and the Eastern\nmodels have been around
    for thousands more years so I want to treat them with\nan equal amount of respect
    and validity</p>\n</div>\n\n        </section>\n    </article>\n</section>"

    for context is that I was diagnosed with bipolar\ndisorder, but not specifically
    type 1 or type 2. This diagnosis came about two\ntimes, once in my late childhood
    and again when I was 19.\nThe diagnosis never made a ton of sense to me, but it
    seemed to almost match some of\nthe things that my mom specifically was concerned
    about.\nThere is another point for later on, which is that part of me wanted to
    be bipolar.\nI felt like it would be cool, but also it made me special.</p>\n<div

    God, the creator of all things, who makes things both\nsoundly and reasonable.
    Mental health is complex because it's not like a broken\narm, throw a cast on,
    and wait... Taking medicine felt almost antithetical to\nmy worldview because
    I had a deep desire to see\nsomething miraculous. So, I backed myself into this
    odd worldview where I\ntaking medicine must be fighting something that God wants
    to do in me with this\nbrokenness. I felt like I was trying to do something maybe
    God didn't want me to\ndo, but was also wrestling with &quot;but if something's
    really wrong (which is\npossible because we live in a broken world) God gifts
    these doctors to come up\nwith this medicine to help heal some of the brokenness.&quot;</p>\n<p>So

    and reflected on being bi-polar I couldn't help but notice\nthat hardly any part
    of the atypical\npieces of myself matched up with bi-polar at all... Around the
    time I started\nto notice this my wife began wondering if I had something more
    akin to ADD. We\ndidn't really understand what that meant, or how it has changed
    over the years,\nor any of it - but based on some initial stereotypes ADHD began
    to become a\ncommon thing we discussed\nAfter some more legitimate research we
    both became pretty convinced that I was\nmeasurably on the Autism Spectrum and
    that certainly there were ADHD tendencies\nthat negatively affected my life. I
    talked with my doctor and after several\npsych evaluations it turns out that my
    self-diagnosis was consistent with the\nconclusion of the evaluation. So if this
    was the end then my thought would've\nbeen</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">I'm not bi-polar</p>\n<p>ok I'm not bi-polar, I'm AuDHD
    - there's some coping mechanisms I can\nlearn now and things make sense.</p>\n</div>\n<p>However,
    this wasn't the end for me - getting diagnosed with AuDHD\ndidn't/hasn't changed
    my life - it's given me a framework by which I can\nunderstand myself in the context
    of our\nWestern world better.\nBut there's a lot more here and as we look ahead,
    I want to be clear that I\ntake no special pride in the AuDHD label...\nI'll talk
    about myself with this label as a way of communicating with people who\nunderstand
    it, but the main point of this post will be in how understanding\nmyself as a
    human being more holistically led to a different point of view of\nwhat the West
    calls neurodivergencies.</p>\n<h1 id=\"treatment\">Treatment <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    Introduction\n\nI was recently diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder Level 1
    and ADHD, the inattentive\ntype. I suppose, AuDHD for short.\nThere are many reasons
    why I now have this official label of AuDHD, not that I\nwas hoping for it, but
    due to a childhood behavioral disorder diagnosis and a\ndesire to understand myself
    better, I decided to start considering that something\nin my childhood issue was
    misunderstood.\n\n!!! note \"\"\n    But what started as simply considering some
    new diagnosis turned into a\n    larger worldview shift when it comes to medicine
    and how we treat people for\n    things we label disorderly.\n\n## Personal History\n\nA
    brief history lesson for context is that I was diagnosed with bipolar\ndisorder,
    but not specifically type 1 or type 2. This diagnosis came about two\ntimes, once
    in my late childhood and again when I was 19.\nThe diagnosis never made a ton
    of sense to me, but it seemed to almost match some of\nthe things that my mom
    specifically was concerned about.\nThere is another point for later on, which
    is that part of me wanted to be bipolar.\nI felt like it would be cool, but also
    it made me special.\n\n!!! warning \"bias\"\n    There's no way that this desire
    didn't turn into massive confirmation bias\n    in getting this diagnosis as a
    kid and as a late teenager.\n\nOnce I started kind of thinking *for myself* a
    little bit - the bipolar diagnosis\nwas one of my first spiritual challenges in
    understanding the brokenness of\nhumanity.\n\n## The Challenge\n\nI believe in
    an orderly God, the creator of all things, who makes things both\nsoundly and
    reasonable. Mental health is complex because it's not like a broken\narm, throw
    a cast on, and wait... Taking medicine felt almost antithetical to\nmy worldview
    because I had a deep desire to see\nsomething miraculous. So, I backed myself
    into this odd worldview where I\ntaking medicine must be fighting something that
    God wants to do in me with this\nbrokenness. I felt like I was trying to do something
    maybe God didn't want me to\ndo, but was also wrestling with \"but if something's
    really wrong (which is\npossible because we live in a broken world) God gifts
    these doctors to come up\nwith this medicine to help heal some of the brokenness.\"\n\nSo
    I had these two competing ideas that were very loud in my head.\n\n!!! note \"\"\n
    \   In hindsight, an AuDHD diagnosis somewhat explains this behavior of mine.\n
    \   Wherein I wanted to be sick, and I had these competing ideas about the\n    character
    of God.\n\nSo I've been more at less at peace with the idea that behavior disorders
    are\napart of life for many people - and that medical treatment can be helpful.\n\n#
    Reflection\n\nAs I've gotten older and reflected on being bi-polar I couldn't
    help but notice\nthat hardly any part of the atypical\npieces of myself matched
    up with bi-polar at all... Around the time I started\nto notice this my wife began
    wondering if I had something more akin to ADD. We\ndidn't really understand what
    that meant, or how it has changed over the years,\nor any of it - but based on
    some initial stereotypes ADHD began to become a\ncommon thing we discussed\nAfter
    some more legitimate research we both became pretty convinced that I was\nmeasurably
    on the Autism Spectrum and that certainly there were ADHD tendencies\nthat negatively
    affected my life. I talked with my doctor and after several\npsych evaluations
    it turns out that my self-diagnosis was consistent with the\nconclusion of the
    evaluation. So if this was the end then my thought would've\nbeen \n\n!!! note
    \"I'm not bi-polar\"\n    ok I'm not bi-polar, I'm AuDHD - there's some coping
    mechanisms I can\n    learn now and things make sense.\n\nHowever, this wasn't
    the end for me - getting diagnosed with AuDHD\ndidn't/hasn't changed my life -
    it's given me a framework by which I can\nunderstand myself in the context of
    our\nWestern world better.\nBut there's a lot more here and as we look ahead,
    I want to be clear that I\ntake no special pride in the AuDHD label...\nI'll talk
    about myself with this label as a way of communicating with people who\nunderstand
    it, but the main point of this post will be in how understanding\nmyself as a
    human being more holistically led to a different point of view of\nwhat the West
    calls neurodivergencies.\n\n# Treatment\n\nI have been taking a light mood stabilizer
    for a while now per my former\nbi-polar diagnosis. There's no doubt that it is
    coincidentally a helpful tool\nin coping with some debilitating aspects of AuDHD
    but the more I reflect the\nmore I want to get away from it - personally.\n\nI'm
    not sure what to think about treatment overall... I recognize that some folks
    are\nmuch more negatively affected by the tendencies we label as neurodivergent
    and\nthat there are meaningful changes that can come from modern western medicine.\nHowever,
    there's also old/ancient and natural solutions to many problems that I\nthink
    are often overlooked \n\n!!! quote \"Simple doesn't mean easy\"\n    often exercise
    and cleaner eating can treat depression and anxiety for\n    example. That doesn't
    mean the anxiety wasn't significant or legitimate, but\n    it's not like a pharmaceutical
    is the only option for treating something\n    legitimate.\n\n!!! warning \"The
    other side\"\n    I also see that obviously there are severe cases of Autism -
    I think we\n    should better understand where that comes from, and I wouldn't
    ever claim\n    that just drinking some tea and figuring out an exercise regime
    can cure\n    something that is fully debilitating.\n\n!!! note \"Las drogas\"\n
    \   I think where I have the biggest issues with \"treatment\" is that taking\n
    \   mental health medication is a fad today... it doesn't mean it's not helpful,\n
    \   but our culture glorifies taking drugs as long as they come from a\n    pharmaceutical
    company. I've personally come across this as I've shared my\n    struggles and
    official AuDHD diagnosis with some friends -  and it's clear that\n    some of
    them give these ads and medicines every ounce of their faith and\n    that's frankly
    concerning in its own way\n    \n## Two Systems | East v West\n\nI've become critical
    of the modern Western perspective on neurodivergence\nand mental/behavioral health.

# Introduction

I was recently diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder Level 1 and ADHD, the inattentive
type. I suppose, AuDHD for short.
There are many reasons why I now have this official label of AuDHD, not that I
was hoping for it, but due to a childhood behavioral disorder diagnosis and a
desire to understand myself better, I decided to start considering that something
in my childhood issue was misunderstood.

!!! note ""
    But what started as simply considering some new diagnosis turned into a
    larger worldview shift when it comes to medicine and how we treat people for
    things we label disorderly.

## Personal History

A brief history lesson for context is that I was diagnosed with bipolar
disorder, but not specifically type 1 or type 2. This diagnosis came about two
times, once in my late childhood and again when I was 19.
The diagnosis never made a ton of sense to me, but it seemed to almost match some of
the things that my mom specifically was concerned about.
There is another point for later on, which is that part of me wanted to be bipolar.
I felt like it would be cool, but also it made me special.

!!! warning "bias"
    There's no way that this desire didn't turn into massive confirmation bias
    in getting this diagnosis as a kid and as a late teenager.

Once I started kind of thinking *for myself* a little bit - the bipolar diagnosis
was one of my first spiritual challenges in understanding the brokenness of
humanity.

## The Challenge

I believe in an orderly God, the creator of all things, who makes things both
soundly and reasonable. Mental health is complex because it's not like a broken
arm, throw a cast on, and wait... Taking medicine felt almost antithetical to
my worldview because I had a deep desire to see
something miraculous. So, I backed myself into this odd worldview where I
taking medicine must be fighting something that God wants to do in me with this
brokenness. I felt like I was trying to do something maybe God didn't want me to
do, but was also wrestling with "but if something's really wrong (which is
possible because we live in a broken world) God gifts these doctors to come up
with this medicine to help heal some of the brokenness."

So I had these two competing ideas that were very loud in my head.

!!! note ""
    In hindsight, an AuDHD diagnosis somewhat explains this behavior of mine.
    Wherein I wanted to be sick, and I had these competing ideas about the
    character of God.

So I've been more at less at peace with the idea that behavior disorders are
apart of life for many people - and that medical treatment can be helpful.

# Reflection

As I've gotten older and reflected on being bi-polar I couldn't help but notice
that hardly any part of the atypical
pieces of myself matched up with bi-polar at all... Around the time I started
to notice this my wife began wondering if I had something more akin to ADD. We
didn't really understand what that meant, or how it has changed over the years,
or any of it - but based on some initial stereotypes ADHD began to become a
common thing we discussed
After some more legitimate research we both became pretty convinced that I was
measurably on the Autism Spectrum and that certainly there were ADHD tendencies
that negatively affected my life. I talked with my doctor and after several
psych evaluations it turns out that my self-diagnosis was consistent with the
conclusion of the evaluation. So if this was the end then my thought would've
been 

!!! note "I'm not bi-polar"
    ok I'm not bi-polar, I'm AuDHD - there's some coping mechanisms I can
    learn now and things make sense.

However, this wasn't the end for me - getting diagnosed with AuDHD
didn't/hasn't changed my life - it's given me a framework by which I can
understand myself in the context of our
Western world better.
But there's a lot more here and as we look ahead, I want to be clear that I
take no special pride in the AuDHD label...
I'll talk about myself with this label as a way of communicating with people who
understand it, but the main point of this post will be in how understanding
myself as a human being more holistically led to a different point of view of
what the West calls neurodivergencies.

# Treatment

I have been taking a light mood stabilizer for a while now per my former
bi-polar diagnosis. There's no doubt that it is coincidentally a helpful tool
in coping with some debilitating aspects of AuDHD but the more I reflect the
more I want to get away from it - personally.

I'm not sure what to think about treatment overall... I recognize that some folks are
much more negatively affected by the tendencies we label as neurodivergent and
that there are meaningful changes that can come from modern western medicine.
However, there's also old/ancient and natural solutions to many problems that I
think are often overlooked 

!!! quote "Simple doesn't mean easy"
    often exercise and cleaner eating can treat depression and anxiety for
    example. That doesn't mean the anxiety wasn't significant or legitimate, but
    it's not like a pharmaceutical is the only option for treating something
    legitimate.

!!! warning "The other side"
    I also see that obviously there are severe cases of Autism - I think we
    should better understand where that comes from, and I wouldn't ever claim
    that just drinking some tea and figuring out an exercise regime can cure
    something that is fully debilitating.

!!! note "Las drogas"
    I think where I have the biggest issues with "treatment" is that taking
    mental health medication is a fad today... it doesn't mean it's not helpful,
    but our culture glorifies taking drugs as long as they come from a
    pharmaceutical company. I've personally come across this as I've shared my
    struggles and official AuDHD diagnosis with some friends -  and it's clear that
    some of them give these ads and medicines every ounce of their faith and
    that's frankly concerning in its own way
    
## Two Systems | East v West

I've become critical of the modern Western perspective on neurodivergence
and mental/behavioral health. It's primarily that I'd be much less skeptical if
it wasn't for all the money... I notice patterns as well that I don't find
comforting - such as the focus on symptoms and isolated treatment of them or
groups of symptoms rather than looking at a human-being as an entire organism or
system. 
I know that certain pieces of a system can break, and sometimes treating
those isolated breakages is the way to go - but also we (in the West) seem to
avoid thinking about ourselves as 1 whole thing... There's language that
younger people use about their "whole self" but honestly I only see them talk
about sexuality as if that defined everything about a person... that's 100% not
what I have in mind here... 

Every one of my psychiatric appointments up through the last few years had never
sought to get me off my medication... It got me thinking the goal was for me to be
a customer for life. I don't like being reliant on anything external and the
fact that there was never a goal for me to be self-sufficient in my own health
became troubling.

My philosophical issues arising with our modern medical systems have led me
to becoming more open to Eastern medicine and as I explore how those systems
have historically analyzed patterns and attributed those patterns to different
ways of thinking, I think the pattern-analysis and subsequent recommendations
can be extremely valuable. This is where adaptogens come in for me.

## Lifestyle Changes

I'd heard of Lion's Mane via some Joe Rogan clips (have become a bigger and
bigger fan of him over the last few years), and then got a subscription to
FourSigmatic which is a coffee company that offers mushroom-replacement and
supplements for coffee and tea basically. So I'm drinking coffee with Lion's
Mane, and have added a few other mushroom tinctures with Reishi and Chaga
specifically, as well as Eleuthero and Turkey Tail as a means of introducing
adaptogens into my routine and maybe it's confirmation bias again, but as I've
gone on and off the Lion's Mane specifically I notice a significant difference
in my cognitive function... When I'm diligent about putting the Lion's Mane
tincture into my coffee in the morning it is like unlocking on-demand
hyper-focus some mornings...

This post is mostly a stream-of-consciousness as I reflect on the atpypical
nature of much of my life, how that fits into the modern Western discourse of
