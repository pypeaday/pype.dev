## ABCMeta

I don't do a lot of OOP currently, but I have been on a few heavy OOP projects and this `ABCMeta` and `abstractmethod` from `abc` would've been super nice to know about!

If you are creating a library with classes that you expect your users to extend, but you want to ensure that any extension has explicit methods defined then this is for you!.

```python
from abc import ABCMeta, abstractmethod
class Family(metaclass=ABCMeta):
    @abstractmethod
    def get_dad(self):
        """Any extension of the Family class must implement a `get_dad` method"""

class MyFamily(Family):
    pass

```

If I try to instantiate `MyFamily` I will not be allowed:
```python

❯ my_fam = MyFamily()
╭─────────────────────────────── Traceback (most recent call last) ────────────────────────────────╮
│ <ipython-input-8-ecb8e21ce815>:1 in <module>                                                     │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class MyFamily with abstract methods get_dad

```

In order for me to extend `Family` I have to implement the method `get_dad`

```python
class MyFamily(Family):
    def get_dad(self):
        return "Me"
```

Now everything works as expected and I can sleep well knowing no one can extend my base class without creating methods I know they need.


```python

my_fam = MyFamily()

my_fam.get_dad()
'Me'

```
