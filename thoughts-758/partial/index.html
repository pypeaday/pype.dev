<p>Here's my thought on <a href="https://distantprovince.by/posts/its-rude-to-show-ai-output-to-people/">💭 It's rude to show AI output to people | Alex Martsinovich</a></p>
<hr />
<p>Great read on LLM output, and the slop that's already been dumped into the internet. I've become a pretty heavy AI user - mostly for code and then thoughts organization. With code (that matters) I review everything AI makes. When I ask gemma3 via ollama to organize my thoughts, I reiterate the importance in my prompt to not re-word things, but to just organize and then help me work through whatever I'm working through in the post.</p>
<p>I've generated a blog post or 2 with AI only, and it's still relatively clear to me when AI writes vs when a human writes. This post does a good job of highlighting how 1. this is a hilariously old sci-fi problem (there's nothing new under the sun, ammirite?) 2. how AI is a useful tool and 3. how in the age of AI we're still actually just battling other humans.... but humans are simple creatures in a lot of ways - we take the path of least resistance the vast majority of the time, and LLM sloppy output that <em>looks</em> not shitty is certainly a low-resistance path to a post or commit... but was the post or commit worth anything?</p>
<p>without proof of thought - no.</p>
