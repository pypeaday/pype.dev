Here's my thought on <a href="https://antfu.me/posts/ai-qrcode-101">ðŸ’­ Stable Diffusion QR Code 101</a>

My brother asked me to generate some QR codes for his link page that I manage. It's been a long time since I've used SD to make codes, and for the life of me I cannot find my notes anywhere... That unfortunate disorganization aside I think I followed Anthony's guides before, and they've only gotten better... 
Time to get prompting!
