<p class="admonition-title">Matthew 5:11-12</p>
<p>11 Blessed are you  when they insult you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things against you, lying on account of me. 12 Rejoice and be glad, because your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets before you.</p>

<p>To drop some context that I'm familiar with, this is from a famous section of
Jesus' &quot;Sermon on the Mount&quot; called &quot;The Beatitudes&quot;. A little unknown fact in
a lot of Christian circles is that these phrases from Matthew 5:3-12 are
derived from some ancient Jewish wisdom (esus didn't come up with these on the
fly). Most of these saying come from something called &quot;The Book of Wisdom&quot;
and they had a history of being used as a way of defining who was close to God
and who wasn't. Jesus takes the ancient and perverted pseudo-wisdom here and
turns it on its head. He's not giving instructions, he's giving correction to
people who have been abused by civic and religious powers at be.</p>

<p>So I know Jesus is not saying I should go out and pursue persecution and
slander. Nor is he saying that just because someone might be mean to me for my
faith, that I'm practicing my faith in an appropriate way.</p>
<p>But what Jesus is doing is acknowledging that the world fundamentally does
reject him. Ultimately, at a level more foundational than the atoms that make
up the universe, creation is broken right now. It's being redeemed, but it's
also broken. In its broken state, like a body that is sick, it might reject
things that are good for it.</p>
<p>Humans are apart of creation, humans are apart of what is broken, and humans,
in our brokenness, reject ultimate goodness by our very broken nature. Jesus
says that when the world persecutes us because of him, it's a simple truth made
manifest... The broken world continues to reject Jesus, and as you or I are
brought further into the fold of God's family, then those outside, those still under
the crushing, oppressive thumb of sin and death, can not
help but carry out their natural inclination against that which is good. It is
quite literally only natural.</p>
<p>So should I find myself offended when someone naturally rejects me on account
of Jesus' presence in my life? I think I should instead almost pity them, and
pray that Jesus calls their name too.</p>
