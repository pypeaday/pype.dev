    \       <p>I really enjoyed the podcast, and it resonated with my experience building
    the\n'rada platform' at my employer. This email turned out a little longer than
    I\nanticipated and if you do take the time to read it fully then awesome, but
    the\nTLDR is this episode brought me down memory lane in a very emotional way...</p>\n<p>Gary
    started the episode by basically describing what my job has been the last\nseveral
    years - I became a DevOps person and then, via a manager seeing value\nin a reorg,
    my now-boss and I were given the opportunity to build a platform.\nWe were both
    data scientists along with 7 other folks, but we naturally\ngravitated towards
    devops/home-labbing/sys adminy kind of things. We were given\nthe chance to become
    a support team for the data scientists rather than \u201Cdo\u201D\nthe data science
    anymore. Now, our \u201Cbusiness\u201D isn\u2019t all of our entire\norganization\u2026
    The \u201CEnterprise\u201D is a fortune 100 company with 100k employees -\nwe
    are a small analytics team embedded in the highest-profit generating\ndivision
    of the business. We don\u2019t have several app teams, we have a handful of\ndata
    scientists who all do a handful of things. Primarily they write data\npipelines
    in python - a process we\u2019ve sense templated and containerized pretty\nbeautifully.
    They also sometimes create web apps (specifically with streamlit,\nbut that's
    not necessarily relevant at a high level). We have a k3s cluster and\nset of helm
    charts for using ArgoCD to manage their web app deployments - it\u2019s\nall apart
    of our centralized CI/CD process. We refer to everything stitched\ntogether as
    the \u201Crada platform\u201D (rada is in internal name). We are the \u201Cteam\nwho
    builds [the platform] and has great relationship with the developers but\naren\u2019t
    necessarily doing the work for them\u201D (1:31 in the episode).</p>\n<p>The Platform
    Product Owner idea is very interesting - it\u2019s coincidentally how I\nhad started
    referring to myself in relationship to rada as the development\ntransitioned from
    the CLI and CI/CD framework towards a desirable web frontend\nto give the devs
    a centralized place to go for info. I didn\u2019t code as much as\nwhen putting
    the CLI and CI/CD branches together, but felt like I was driving\nthe features
    and design and architecture along with Waylon (my boss). I recall\nlast year or
    so saying that I felt more like a product owner than a developer\n(in some ways).</p>\n<p>Sean
    bringing up \u201Cshift left\u201D was another particularly relevant note, or\nanti-relevant
    perhaps\u2026 Rada strived in the beginning to be a \u201Chyper developer\nfocused\u201D
    experience. Our goal with rada was to make a data scientist\u2019s job in\nour
    team an absolute dream - and we\u2019ve mostly accomplished that goal, and\ncontinue
    to accomplish it with daily continual improvement. What I mean is that\nthe data
    scientist doesn\u2019t care about ops AT ALL (or very little). To them,\nthey
    clone a template repo and write python code. Data connections, pipelines\ndeployment
    and everything surrounding the operational side of things is done by\nsets of
    tooling within the rada platform. The genesis for this focus was that\nour entire
    team was spending multiple hours per person per week, every week,\nscheduling
    and configuring things in the AWS and Azure DevOps consoles. That\nwas the first
    thing I personally did - was automate and centralize those\nconfiguration workloads.
    So in a sense I implemented DevOps by focusing on\ntaking Ops away from the developers
    but providing a way that is laser-focused\non this small group\u2019s use cases.</p>\n<p>Gary\u2019s
    memory of the UK client with a few EKS clusters is very in-step with the\nactual
    platform side of rada. We have some helm charts and a self-managed k3s\nnode along
    with some automation around cert and domain requesting that makes it\npossible
    for our data scientists to have a streamlit app deployed with a nice\nhttps://myapp.our_team.corp.com
    in our walled-off corporate intranet, but\nfurthermore - that node helps us navigate
    the Border Patrol Team, GIS security,\nand multiple cloud teams required to connect
    to data in the cloud from on prem\nresources\u2026 the rada platform conveniently
    takes advantage of existing\ncorporate-approved pathways to bring relevant data
    right to the data scientists\nthrough common interfaces. It\u2019s not much in
    the way of supporting a\nmillion-user app, but it\u2019s a beautiful, albeit scrappy
    setup to give our\ndevelopers a very smooth path to deploying something for their
    customers\n(internal engineers usually) that would otherwise be literally impossible
    to\nnavigate fresh for every app. Honestly, the way our team is setup makes me\nthink
    it\u2019s the way every data analytics team should be setup - with a small set\nof
    dedicated resources to manage their operations so they can focus on data.\nNow
    \u201Csmall set of dedicated resources\u201D looks different at different scales
    of\nenterprise certainly, but I\u2019ve been in several data-related groups within
    my\nemployer (Fortune 100 company since forever, 100k employees) and every one
    of\nthem has terrible deployment and operational experiences for the data\nscientist.
    The idea of offloading that onto someone whose actual responsibility\nit was to
    manage and be accountable for made sense and I don\u2019t know why more\ngroups
    weren\u2019t setup how ours got to be.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, I think the
    position we\u2019re in now is fundamentally better than whatever\nhas gone before,
    right? And I guess that\u2019s partly human nature because we\nalways want to
    make things better and improve on things. But I think by and\nlarge, companies
    who do this well have developers that are more productive.\nops people who are
    happier and hopefully have shifted left still in the ways\nthat made sense. (8:54)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This
    is so true for our group (not the company necessarily) - our data\nscientists
    are very productive, and happy. And as the ops guy - my job rocks...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And
    although our developers did have full admin access to Azure and the\nconsole and
    the CLI and everything else, what they didn't have the kind of\nunderlying knowledge
    of is what does our network look like on-premises? How\ndoes the routing work
    to get back to our data center? What data center even\nis the database that I
    want to talk to sitting in? So there\u2019s a whole bunch\nof context that I don\u2019t
    think it\u2019s reasonable to expect a developer to know\nor understand. (17:27)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This
    quote from Gary rang very true to me as well. The data scientists I work\nwith
    are smart guys for sure, with varying levels of technical curiosity. But\nultimately,
    even the most curious one was miles away for understanding\nnetworking, firewall
    rules, proxies, Logical Technical Architecture diagrams,\netc. These were things
    I don\u2019t necessarily have a passion for, but things I\ncame to understand
    to (apparently) significantly deeper degrees than my\nco-workers, but that skill
    distinction is one of the things that opened the\ndoor to our own little platform
    in-house. It\u2019s been awesome and this episode\nlet me relive a lot of good
    times.</p>\n<p>I will wrap up my message to y\u2019all out of respect for everyone\u2019s
    time if you\nread this far\u2026 I said above that my job rocks, which is true
    and it\u2019s one\nreason this episode has been such a whirlwind for me, because
    my employer\ncreated a remote role for me to take 4 years ago. I took it, moved
    away, and in\nthis role is where I created rada from inception and became familiar
    with\nplatform engineering as a concept. Well, due to their RTO (return to office)\nmandates
    it looks like I\u2019m going to lose the thing I created and love because\nthey
    want me to now uproot the life I was told I could go build, to come back\nto an
    office. I won\u2019t rant much more about that - I\u2019ve excelled in reviews
    all\n4 years in this role and, not to brag, but I have a great reputation. I\u2019m
    very\nupset - not about losing my job, there's more work out there, but about
    having\nrada taken from me for the most unreasonable reason I could think of...
    This\nepisode allowed me to remember a lot of the good things about what I built.
    I\nhave fond memories of development and problem solving with Waylon as well as\nthe
    data scientists as we built out features of the platform (and continue to).\nIt\u2019s
    something I will certainly miss but Hybrid Cloud Show EP 37 is bookmarked\nforever
    if I want to relive those memories via your conversation again.</p>\n\n    </section>\n</article>

    \       <p>I really enjoyed the podcast, and it resonated with my experience building
    the\n'rada platform' at my employer. This email turned out a little longer than
    I\nanticipated and if you do take the time to read it fully then awesome, but
    the\nTLDR is this episode brought me down memory lane in a very emotional way...</p>\n<p>Gary
    started the episode by basically describing what my job has been the last\nseveral
    years - I became a DevOps person and then, via a manager seeing value\nin a reorg,
    my now-boss and I were given the opportunity to build a platform.\nWe were both
    data scientists along with 7 other folks, but we naturally\ngravitated towards
    devops/home-labbing/sys adminy kind of things. We were given\nthe chance to become
    a support team for the data scientists rather than \u201Cdo\u201D\nthe data science
    anymore. Now, our \u201Cbusiness\u201D isn\u2019t all of our entire\norganization\u2026
    The \u201CEnterprise\u201D is a fortune 100 company with 100k employees -\nwe
    are a small analytics team embedded in the highest-profit generating\ndivision
    of the business. We don\u2019t have several app teams, we have a handful of\ndata
    scientists who all do a handful of things. Primarily they write data\npipelines
    in python - a process we\u2019ve sense templated and containerized pretty\nbeautifully.
    They also sometimes create web apps (specifically with streamlit,\nbut that's
    not necessarily relevant at a high level). We have a k3s cluster and\nset of helm
    charts for using ArgoCD to manage their web app deployments - it\u2019s\nall apart
    of our centralized CI/CD process. We refer to everything stitched\ntogether as
    the \u201Crada platform\u201D (rada is in internal name). We are the \u201Cteam\nwho
    builds [the platform] and has great relationship with the developers but\naren\u2019t
    necessarily doing the work for them\u201D (1:31 in the episode).</p>\n<p>The Platform
    Product Owner idea is very interesting - it\u2019s coincidentally how I\nhad started
    referring to myself in relationship to rada as the development\ntransitioned from
    the CLI and CI/CD framework towards a desirable web frontend\nto give the devs
    a centralized place to go for info. I didn\u2019t code as much as\nwhen putting
    the CLI and CI/CD branches together, but felt like I was driving\nthe features
    and design and architecture along with Waylon (my boss). I recall\nlast year or
    so saying that I felt more like a product owner than a developer\n(in some ways).</p>\n<p>Sean
    bringing up \u201Cshift left\u201D was another particularly relevant note, or\nanti-relevant
    perhaps\u2026 Rada strived in the beginning to be a \u201Chyper developer\nfocused\u201D
    experience. Our goal with rada was to make a data scientist\u2019s job in\nour
    team an absolute dream - and we\u2019ve mostly accomplished that goal, and\ncontinue
    to accomplish it with daily continual improvement. What I mean is that\nthe data
    scientist doesn\u2019t care about ops AT ALL (or very little). To them,\nthey
    clone a template repo and write python code. Data connections, pipelines\ndeployment
    and everything surrounding the operational side of things is done by\nsets of
    tooling within the rada platform. The genesis for this focus was that\nour entire
    team was spending multiple hours per person per week, every week,\nscheduling
    and configuring things in the AWS and Azure DevOps consoles. That\nwas the first
    thing I personally did - was automate and centralize those\nconfiguration workloads.
    So in a sense I implemented DevOps by focusing on\ntaking Ops away from the developers
    but providing a way that is laser-focused\non this small group\u2019s use cases.</p>\n<p>Gary\u2019s
    memory of the UK client with a few EKS clusters is very in-step with the\nactual
    platform side of rada. We have some helm charts and a self-managed k3s\nnode along
    with some automation around cert and domain requesting that makes it\npossible
    for our data scientists to have a streamlit app deployed with a nice\nhttps://myapp.our_team.corp.com
    in our walled-off corporate intranet, but\nfurthermore - that node helps us navigate
    the Border Patrol Team, GIS security,\nand multiple cloud teams required to connect
    to data in the cloud from on prem\nresources\u2026 the rada platform conveniently
    takes advantage of existing\ncorporate-approved pathways to bring relevant data
    right to the data scientists\nthrough common interfaces. It\u2019s not much in
    the way of supporting a\nmillion-user app, but it\u2019s a beautiful, albeit scrappy
    setup to give our\ndevelopers a very smooth path to deploying something for their
    customers\n(internal engineers usually) that would otherwise be literally impossible
    to\nnavigate fresh for every app. Honestly, the way our team is setup makes me\nthink
    it\u2019s the way every data analytics team should be setup - with a small set\nof
    dedicated resources to manage their operations so they can focus on data.\nNow
    \u201Csmall set of dedicated resources\u201D looks different at different scales
    of\nenterprise certainly, but I\u2019ve been in several data-related groups within
    my\nemployer (Fortune 100 company since forever, 100k employees) and every one
    of\nthem has terrible deployment and operational experiences for the data\nscientist.
    The idea of offloading that onto someone whose actual responsibility\nit was to
    manage and be accountable for made sense and I don\u2019t know why more\ngroups
    weren\u2019t setup how ours got to be.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, I think the
    position we\u2019re in now is fundamentally better than whatever\nhas gone before,
    right? And I guess that\u2019s partly human nature because we\nalways want to
    make things better and improve on things. But I think by and\nlarge, companies
    who do this well have developers that are more productive.\nops people who are
    happier and hopefully have shifted left still in the ways\nthat made sense. (8:54)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This
    is so true for our group (not the company necessarily) - our data\nscientists
    are very productive, and happy. And as the ops guy - my job rocks...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And
    although our developers did have full admin access to Azure and the\nconsole and
    the CLI and everything else, what they didn't have the kind of\nunderlying knowledge
    of is what does our network look like on-premises? How\ndoes the routing work
    to get back to our data center? What data center even\nis the database that I
    want to talk to sitting in? So there\u2019s a whole bunch\nof context that I don\u2019t
    think it\u2019s reasonable to expect a developer to know\nor understand. (17:27)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This
    quote from Gary rang very true to me as well. The data scientists I work\nwith
    are smart guys for sure, with varying levels of technical curiosity. But\nultimately,
    even the most curious one was miles away for understanding\nnetworking, firewall
    rules, proxies, Logical Technical Architecture diagrams,\netc. These were things
    I don\u2019t necessarily have a passion for, but things I\ncame to understand
    to (apparently) significantly deeper degrees than my\nco-workers, but that skill
    distinction is one of the things that opened the\ndoor to our own little platform
    in-house. It\u2019s been awesome and this episode\nlet me relive a lot of good
    times.</p>\n<p>I will wrap up my message to y\u2019all out of respect for everyone\u2019s
    time if you\nread this far\u2026 I said above that my job rocks, which is true
    and it\u2019s one\nreason this episode has been such a whirlwind for me, because
    my employer\ncreated a remote role for me to take 4 years ago. I took it, moved
    away, and in\nthis role is where I created rada from inception and became familiar
    with\nplatform engineering as a concept. Well, due to their RTO (return to office)\nmandates
    it looks like I\u2019m going to lose the thing I created and love because\nthey
    want me to now uproot the life I was told I could go build, to come back\nto an
    office. I won\u2019t rant much more about that - I\u2019ve excelled in reviews
    all\n4 years in this role and, not to brag, but I have a great reputation. I\u2019m
    very\nupset - not about losing my job, there's more work out there, but about
    having\nrada taken from me for the most unreasonable reason I could think of...
    This\nepisode allowed me to remember a lot of the good things about what I built.
    I\nhave fond memories of development and problem solving with Waylon as well as\nthe
    data scientists as we built out features of the platform (and continue to).\nIt\u2019s
    something I will certainly miss but Hybrid Cloud Show EP 37 is bookmarked\nforever
    if I want to relive those memories via your conversation again.</p>\n\n    </section>\n</article>"

    the podcast, and it resonated with my experience building the\n'rada platform'
    at my employer. This email turned out a little longer than I\nanticipated and
    if you do take the time to read it fully then awesome, but the\nTLDR is this episode
    brought me down memory lane in a very emotional way...</p>\n<p>Gary started the
    episode by basically describing what my job has been the last\nseveral years -
    I became a DevOps person and then, via a manager seeing value\nin a reorg, my
    now-boss and I were given the opportunity to build a platform.\nWe were both data
    scientists along with 7 other folks, but we naturally\ngravitated towards devops/home-labbing/sys
    adminy kind of things. We were given\nthe chance to become a support team for
    the data scientists rather than \u201Cdo\u201D\nthe data science anymore. Now,
    our \u201Cbusiness\u201D isn\u2019t all of our entire\norganization\u2026 The
    \u201CEnterprise\u201D is a fortune 100 company with 100k employees -\nwe are
    a small analytics team embedded in the highest-profit generating\ndivision of
    the business. We don\u2019t have several app teams, we have a handful of\ndata
    scientists who all do a handful of things. Primarily they write data\npipelines
    in python - a process we\u2019ve sense templated and containerized pretty\nbeautifully.
    They also sometimes create web apps (specifically with streamlit,\nbut that's
    not necessarily relevant at a high level). We have a k3s cluster and\nset of helm
    charts for using ArgoCD to manage their web app deployments - it\u2019s\nall apart
    of our centralized CI/CD process. We refer to everything stitched\ntogether as
    the \u201Crada platform\u201D (rada is in internal name). We are the \u201Cteam\nwho
    builds [the platform] and has great relationship with the developers but\naren\u2019t
    necessarily doing the work for them\u201D (1:31 in the episode).</p>\n<p>The Platform
    Product Owner idea is very interesting - it\u2019s coincidentally how I\nhad started
    referring to myself in relationship to rada as the development\ntransitioned from
    the CLI and CI/CD framework towards a desirable web frontend\nto give the devs
    a centralized place to go for info. I didn\u2019t code as much as\nwhen putting
    the CLI and CI/CD branches together, but felt like I was driving\nthe features
    and design and architecture along with Waylon (my boss). I recall\nlast year or
    so saying that I felt more like a product owner than a developer\n(in some ways).</p>\n<p>Sean
    bringing up \u201Cshift left\u201D was another particularly relevant note, or\nanti-relevant
    perhaps\u2026 Rada strived in the beginning to be a \u201Chyper developer\nfocused\u201D
    experience. Our goal with rada was to make a data scientist\u2019s job in\nour
    team an absolute dream - and we\u2019ve mostly accomplished that goal, and\ncontinue
    to accomplish it with daily continual improvement. What I mean is that\nthe data
    scientist doesn\u2019t care about ops AT ALL (or very little). To them,\nthey
    clone a template repo and write python code. Data connections, pipelines\ndeployment
    and everything surrounding the operational side of things is done by\nsets of
    tooling within the rada platform. The genesis for this focus was that\nour entire
    team was spending multiple hours per person per week, every week,\nscheduling
    and configuring things in the AWS and Azure DevOps consoles. That\nwas the first
    thing I personally did - was automate and centralize those\nconfiguration workloads.
    So in a sense I implemented DevOps by focusing on\ntaking Ops away from the developers
    but providing a way that is laser-focused\non this small group\u2019s use cases.</p>\n<p>Gary\u2019s
    memory of the UK client with a few EKS clusters is very in-step with the\nactual
    platform side of rada. We have some helm charts and a self-managed k3s\nnode along
    with some automation around cert and domain requesting that makes it\npossible
    for our data scientists to have a streamlit app deployed with a nice\nhttps://myapp.our_team.corp.com
    in our walled-off corporate intranet, but\nfurthermore - that node helps us navigate
    the Border Patrol Team, GIS security,\nand multiple cloud teams required to connect
    to data in the cloud from on prem\nresources\u2026 the rada platform conveniently
    takes advantage of existing\ncorporate-approved pathways to bring relevant data
    right to the data scientists\nthrough common interfaces. It\u2019s not much in
    the way of supporting a\nmillion-user app, but it\u2019s a beautiful, albeit scrappy
    setup to give our\ndevelopers a very smooth path to deploying something for their
    customers\n(internal engineers usually) that would otherwise be literally impossible
    to\nnavigate fresh for every app. Honestly, the way our team is setup makes me\nthink
    it\u2019s the way every data analytics team should be setup - with a small set\nof
    dedicated resources to manage their operations so they can focus on data.\nNow
    \u201Csmall set of dedicated resources\u201D looks different at different scales
    of\nenterprise certainly, but I\u2019ve been in several data-related groups within
    my\nemployer (Fortune 100 company since forever, 100k employees) and every one
    of\nthem has terrible deployment and operational experiences for the data\nscientist.
    The idea of offloading that onto someone whose actual responsibility\nit was to
    manage and be accountable for made sense and I don\u2019t know why more\ngroups
    weren\u2019t setup how ours got to be.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, I think the
    position we\u2019re in now is fundamentally better than whatever\nhas gone before,
    right? And I guess that\u2019s partly human nature because we\nalways want to
    make things better and improve on things. But I think by and\nlarge, companies
    who do this well have developers that are more productive.\nops people who are
    happier and hopefully have shifted left still in the ways\nthat made sense. (8:54)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This
    is so true for our group (not the company necessarily) - our data\nscientists
    are very productive, and happy. And as the ops guy - my job rocks...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And
    although our developers did have full admin access to Azure and the\nconsole and
    the CLI and everything else, what they didn't have the kind of\nunderlying knowledge
    of is what does our network look like on-premises? How\ndoes the routing work
    to get back to our data center? What data center even\nis the database that I
    want to talk to sitting in? So there\u2019s a whole bunch\nof context that I don\u2019t
    think it\u2019s reasonable to expect a developer to know\nor understand. (17:27)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This
    quote from Gary rang very true to me as well. The data scientists I work\nwith
    are smart guys for sure, with varying levels of technical curiosity. But\nultimately,
    even the most curious one was miles away for understanding\nnetworking, firewall
    rules, proxies, Logical Technical Architecture diagrams,\netc. These were things
    I don\u2019t necessarily have a passion for, but things I\ncame to understand
    to (apparently) significantly deeper degrees than my\nco-workers, but that skill
    distinction is one of the things that opened the\ndoor to our own little platform
    in-house. It\u2019s been awesome and this episode\nlet me relive a lot of good
    times.</p>\n<p>I will wrap up my message to y\u2019all out of respect for everyone\u2019s
    time if you\nread this far\u2026 I said above that my job rocks, which is true
    and it\u2019s one\nreason this episode has been such a whirlwind for me, because
    my employer\ncreated a remote role for me to take 4 years ago. I took it, moved
    away, and in\nthis role is where I created rada from inception and became familiar
    with\nplatform engineering as a concept. Well, due to their RTO (return to office)\nmandates
    it looks like I\u2019m going to lose the thing I created and love because\nthey
    want me to now uproot the life I was told I could go build, to come back\nto an

    all\n4 years in this role and, not to brag, but I have a great reputation. I\u2019m
    very\nupset - not about losing my job, there's more work out there, but about
    having\nrada taken from me for the most unreasonable reason I could think of...
    This\nepisode allowed me to remember a lot of the good things about what I built.
    I\nhave fond memories of development and problem solving with Waylon as well as\nthe
