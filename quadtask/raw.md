QuadTask is a simple productivity app that I'm sure will bring in $0 towards my retirement but a few friends use it and it's a fun project to use as fodder for learning how to pair program with AI.

The app is live here - [quadtask.app](https://quadtask.app)

## Updates

1. I can add SMS notifications with the SMTP trick
2. retire quadtask.app and just have it live on fly

- TODO: update the email from <nic@quadtask.app> to <nic@mydigitalharbor.com>
