There's a ton of AI related tools I want to play with, and there are several I run in docker pretty willy nilly. However, the MCP server stuff as of late has felt fast and borderline reckless so I like seeing a project seeking to make it easy to sandbox code... I get blocked by this idea cause I'll want to setup a VM on a VLAN or something before just spinning up an mcp server idk if I should trust - but if I can do it with a library then that's amazing!

We just have to hope the motivation to try this stays strong enough to get started
