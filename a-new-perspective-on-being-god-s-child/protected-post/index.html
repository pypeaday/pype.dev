<p>I was in men's group the other day, and one of the things that came up almost inevitably
is a debate between God's sovereignty and predestination, and then an idea of free will.
I have been a part of these conversations for years - I've been in hundreds of them certainly,
and they all go in a very similar direction. Almost irrespective of the theological prowess
or training of the group of people I'm in the unspoken goal always is the same...
<strong>to find a hard and fast line between the 2 things or to find some comfortable verbiage for the tension</strong></p>

<p>People with no real theological background have very simple ideas and
understandings of free will and God's sovereignty.
They typically equate God's sovereignty with &quot;He willed everything to be, and so you don't
actually have any real choices.&quot;
Then they think that because God has ultimate sovereignty, but they have free will, they
can somehow contradict God's will, but then they don't understand that that is a violation
of the doctrine of God's sovereignty.
So those conversations are typically hard to sit through, and my historical thought
on that, ever since I believe I've come to a pretty mature position on the matter,
has been that in the Hebrew mind, these things aren't at odds, and we create the division with our
Western ideals on what it means to make choices, and what it means to be free.</p>
<h3>Freedom</h3>
<p>As a quick parenthetical remark on that - freedom is not doing whatever you want.
True freedom is living in accordance with your creation, bound by the things that create
order, because it is within those boundaries that you were designed to live -
and thus the life you live within the boundaries is the best the life could
be... Freedom isn't the ultimate goal, it's a byproduct of living in accordance
with our design.
When you break those boundaries though - then life is scary, and you are not
free but rather a slave to the environment you made for yourself - an
environment not designed for you because you designed it for yourself, it isn't
what the Maker made for you</p>
<h3>Freedom - Child's Play</h3>
<p>An easy example is kids on a playground.
If you give a bunch of little kids a playground with nice high fences, and you tell them to
do whatever they want in the playground, they'll have a great time.
But if you take all the fences away from that playground, maybe even move it
out further away from the school, kids tend to feel a lot less safe.
Because now, not only can they just wander as far away from it as they please, perhaps

<p>Returning to the sovereignty and free will discussion...
With no academic, theological, or honestly even critical thinking
applied, we have this very silly juxtaposition of sovereignty - as if it means
you can't make choices - and free will as if God's sovereignty could be usurped
by us.
However, in groups where we have more theological training present, we really just have the
same (directionally speaking - the same) conversation, with a larger vocabulary.
Now we have words like &quot;agency&quot;, and &quot;scope of choice&quot;, things that kind of seek to explain
away the tension by introducing new dimension or element of abstraction to the argument.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, we're now just cutting the cake into smaller pieces.
We're just filling in some of the gaps that we can see.
There's still nuance.
There's still the Western influence of needing to label everything.
There's still, in my opinion, the ancient truth that in the Hebrew mind, Yahweh's sovereignty
and the human's choice to live their life are not at odds with each other.</p>

<p>But here's a thought I started to formulate just recently...</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">a recent thought</p>
<p>Even for a PhD in theological studies or in theology or an expert in church history or
church fathers or whatever - for somebody <em>today</em> to think that we can define these terms
in a totally correct and understandable way is another manifestation of the
<strong>PEAK ARROGANCE</strong> of the West  (Blog on Western v Eastern medicine in the works)</p>
</div>
<p>I don't mean to claim here that I have the <em>right</em> understanding of sovereignty and free will.
But Paul has some choice words for believers who love quarreling and debates, and he calls
them spiritual children who aren't ready for real food.</p>
<div class="admonition source">
<p class="admonition-title">2 Timothy 2:23-24</p>
<p>23 But reject foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they breed quarrels.
24 The Lord's slave must not quarrel, but must be gentle to everyone, able to teach, and patient,</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition source">
<p class="admonition-title">1 Corinthians 3</p>
<p>1For my part, brothers and sisters, I was not able to speak to you as spiritual
people but as people of the flesh, as babies in Christ.a 2I gave you milk to
drink, not solid food, since you were not yet ready for it. In fact, you are
still not ready, 3because you are still worldly. For since there is envya and
strifea b among you, are you not worldly and behaving like mere humans? 4For
whenever someone says, “I belong to Paul,” and another, “I belong to Apollos,”a</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">It's you</p>
<p>I've often heard the Corinthian church used as an example of a bad place to
be - and no doubt it was. But modern American Christianity may be much closer
to Corinth than Thessolinca as far as maturity and Christ-like living goes.</p>
</div>
<p>He says things like &quot;I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, since you were
not yet ready for it&quot;
I used to think that the &quot;real food&quot; was these theological debates, that you learn
more about the Bible, you learn more about humanity, and then you can have these more
in-depth conversations.
But I think the real wisdom is easly seen with a metaphor</p>
<h3>Who's the child here?</h3>
<p>I have two daughters in different developmental stages, and so we have 3 characters...
There's my young daughter, my older daughter, and me.
Right away, I think we often talk about knowing God in this kind of a term where,
you know, I'm his child and I have children.
So there's a parent-child relationship.
And then in the God-human relationship, I understand my position better now as a parent
of real children, of humans, which helps me understand my position as a child of God.</p>
<div class="admonition failure">
<p>I don't think we take that very seriously.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition success">
<p>I think use this more as comforting language rather than a humbling truth - <strong>I'm a child of God</strong>
But really, I think the TLDR is that even the most highly trained theological individual - that person is not a grown-up in the eyes of God.
He or she is still a child, and our understanding is still limited to what a child can understand.</p>
</div>
<p>Let's continue with the metaphor...</p>
<p>You could ask either one of my daughters if they know me, and of course they would both
say yes, and they know me to different degrees.
Perhaps because the older one knows more about me - does that mean that she knows me better than the younger?
I think it would be silly to say yes.
Both of my kids know me to the fullest capacity that they can know me.
So what about love?
Do they both love me?
And do I love them?
Of course.
And do I show my love to both of them in the same ways?
Of course not.
Not only are they unique, but they're at different stages in life...</p>
<p>For example - I don't exercise the same amount of discipline towards my
youngest because she's not ready for it - it's not reasonable to expect the
same things of her as our older daughter.
Speaking of her - she absolutely is ready for some more discipline and for some
higher expectations, and so I will train her up in the ways that she is mature
enough to understand.
Now, does that mean I love my younger daughter less, or does it mean I love my older daughter
more?
No.
It means I'm loving them in a way that is appropriate for where they are at
developmentally, for their better good.
So that they grow up to be ordered, to be competent, to be self-controlled, and
to not grow up to be wild adults with no regard for boundaries and rules.</p>
<p>So to be specific about the metaphor and the example I just laid out: I don't want my children
to ever hurt or suffer, but I also know that suffering is required for learning and for them to grow to be mature individuals.
I know how to control some of the inevitable suffering a child must endure, especially if it's in the form of discipline, for my children so they are safe, protected, loved, but also corrected and molded into competent human beings.</p>
<h3>The Kicker</h3>
<p>Now would it be appropriate for my older daughter (who understands that suffering is required
for learning) would it be appropriate for her to look at my younger daughter and tell
her, &quot;dad wants you to suffer&quot;?
That's tough, isn't it...
Because she's not really lying, but more importantly she's also not telling anything close to the whole
truth and she is also not talking to somebody who is capable of understanding the nuances
of that truth.</p>
<p>In the eyes of God, I'm still a five-year-old.</p>
<p>And for me as a five-year-old boy in the eyes of the Lord, to try and explain things that
I think I understand or that I understand to the best capability that a five-year-old can -
If I go try to teach a three-year-old things about God in ways that they can't understand,
I am not loving that other person and I'm not even loving God very well.
I'm just stuck in my own arrogance of understanding, thinking that I now get it because I've come
to my own realization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recognize there's a little irony now in writing this post because I'm
saying I think I kind of understand that I don't/can't understand the sovereignty
and free will relationship. I wouldn't say I can explain that away, but I
think I understand who I am better in the eyes of the Lord and what I could
reasonably expect to understand from an academic standpoint.</p>

<p>The lesson for me, and for my community of faith - is to calm down about the
debates.... They're fun over a drink and cigars, but when boots are on the
ground we need to remember that the Bible has information that we need to know,
it doesn't have all the information that we want to know - and the American
Church must drop its arrogant need to explain away every mystery and instead
hold fast to the God of those mysteries.</p>
