Here's my thought on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12465978/can-aws-security-groups-on-one-aws-account-reference-security-groups-in-another">ðŸ’­ Cross Account AWS Security Group ID Reference</a>

I needed to update some ingress rules across several AWS accounts and ran into an issue when I had to reference a security group id in another account - turns out <accountid>/<securitygroupid> is the money maker

EDIT: this requires VPC Peering...
