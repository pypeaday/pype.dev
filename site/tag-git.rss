<p>I try to commit a lot, and I also try to write useful tests appropriate for the scope of work I'm focusing on, but sometimes I drop the ball...</p>
<p>Whether by laziness, ignorance, or accepted tech debt I don't always code perfectly and recently I was dozens of commits into a new feature before realizing I broke something along the way that none of my tests caught...</p>
<p>Before today I would've manually reviewed every commit to see if something obvious slipped by me (talk about a time suck 😩)</p>
<p><u>There must be a better way</u></p>
<h1><a href="#bisect" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="bisect"></a>Bisect?</h1>
<p><code>git bisect</code> is the magic sauce for this exact problem...</p>
<p>You essentially create a range of commits to consider and let <code>git bisect</code> guide you through them in a manner akin to Newton's method for finding the root of a continuous function.</p>
<h1><a href="#how-to-do-it" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="how-to-do-it"></a>How to do it?</h1>
<p>Start with <code>git bisect start</code> and then choose the first <code>good</code> commit (ie. a commit you know the bug isn't present in)</p>

<p>After starting bisect with a &quot;good&quot; start commit and a &quot;bad&quot; ending commit we can let git to it's thing!</p>
<p>Git checksout a commit somewhere about halfway between the good and bad commit so you can see if your bug is there or not.</p>

<p>If you work with a template for several projects then you might sometimes need to do the same action across all repos.
A good example of this is updating a package in <code>requirements.txt</code> in every project, or refactoring a common module.
If you have several repos to do this across then it can be time consuming... enter <code>mu-repo</code></p>
<h2><a href="#mu" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="mu"></a>Mu</h2>
<p><a href="https://fabioz.github.io/mu-repo/">mu-repo</a> is an awesome cli tool for working with multiple git repositories at the same time.
There are several things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>mu status</code> will give you the <code>git status</code> of every registered repo (see below)</li>
<li><code>mu sh</code> will let you execute system level commands in every repo</li>
<li><code>mu stash</code> will stash all changes across all registered repos</li>
<li>There's literally a ton more but these are some handy ones</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#registration" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="registration"></a>Registration</h2>
<p><code>mu</code> tracks its own <code>groups</code>, and there is a default group when no particular one is active.
It's as simple as <code>mu register proj1 prog2 ...</code> to get repos registered</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
❯ mu register proj1 proj2
Repository: proj1 registered
Repository: proj2 registered

❯ mu status

  proj1 : git status
    On branch main

    No commits yet

    Untracked files:
    (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
    requirements.txt

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)

  proj2 : git status
    On branch main

    No commits yet

    Changes to be committed:
    (use &quot;git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
    new file:   requirements.txt


</code></pre>
<h2><a href="#working-with-mu" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="working-with-mu"></a>Working with mu</h2>
<p>As you can see above I have two projects each with a <code>requirements.txt</code> added but not committed yet.
Using <code>mu</code> I can stage this change across both repos at once.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
❯ mu add requirements.txt

  proj1 : git add requirements.txt

  proj2 : git add requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<p>Then as you might imagine, I can make the commit in each repo</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
❯ mu commit -m &quot;Add requirements.txts&quot;

  proj1 : git commit -m Add requirements.txts
    [main (root-commit) 18376d7] Add requirements.txts
    1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
    create mode 100644 requirements.txt

  proj2 : git commit -m Add requirements.txts
    [main (root-commit) 18376d7] Add requirements.txts
    1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
    create mode 100644 requirements.txt
</code></pre>
<h2><a href="#mu-groups" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="mu-groups"></a>mu groups</h2>
<p>The other thing I got a lot of use out of recently was <code>mu</code>'s groups.
At work I have about 40 repos cloned that are all based on the same kedro pipeline template.
Some of these projects have been deprecated.
I also have several more repos that are not kedro template - custom libraries or something.
<code>group</code> let me utilize <code>mu</code> across different groups of repos.</p>
<p>Say <code>proj2</code> is a deprecated project that I don't need to worry about making changes to anymore.
I don't just have to unregister it, instead I can make a group called &quot;active&quot; and register <code>proj1</code> in that group</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
❯ mu group add active --empty

~/personal
❯ mu group add deprecated --empty

~/personal
❯ mu group
  active
* deprecated

</code></pre>
<p>The <code>*</code> tells me which group is active.
The <code>--empty</code> flag tells <code>mu</code> to not add all registered repos to that group.
If I don't want to use any groups then <code>mu group reset</code> will go back to the default group with all registered repos.</p>
<p>With groups I can register only the repos that I want to be working across in their own group and not worry about affecting other repos with my batch changes!</p>

<h2><a href="#git" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="git"></a>Git</h2>
<p>Hopefully if you write code you are using git, if not go learn the basics of <code>commit</code>, <code>pull</code>, <code>push</code>, and <code>pull request</code>/<code>merge request</code> like... right now.</p>
<p>Assuming you are at least familiar with git then you probably work the same way I have since I've been using it.</p>
<ol>
<li>clone or initialize a repo</li>
<li>checkout a branch, <code>git checkout -b my-feature</code></li>
<li>work on <code>my-feature</code> and when ready open a PR into <code>main</code></li>
<li><code>git pull main</code> then <code>git checkout -b another-feature</code></li>
<li>etc...</li>
</ol>
<p>What if you need to switch between branches for some reason? Often I'm jumping into projects with my co-workers left and right, and I'll have changes that I'm either working on or exploring for them.
When it's time to switch branches I think there's more elegant ways than this but I've always done this:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>stash</code> the current changes</li>
<li>checkout out the relevant branch</li>
<li>helped out</li>
<li>re-checkout my original branch</li>
<li><code>pop</code> the <code>stash</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, that's not awful but I think <code>worktrees</code> will make this nicer for a few reasons!</p>
<h2><a href="#worktrees" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="worktrees"></a>Worktrees</h2>
<p>Worktrees are linked branches that have their own directories somewhere on your computer.
To checkout a branch you don't have to worry about stashing any changes, you just <code>cd</code> into the directory of that branch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The branch can be literally anywhere - it doesn't have to be in the repo folder</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a href="#use-case" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="use-case"></a>Use Case</h2>
<p>I've seen ThePrimeagean argue for worktrees for several reasons, see a YT video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uEqYw-N8uE">here</a></p>
<p>I'm entirely in Python at the moment, or working with projects that dont' have that kind of requirement (ie. this website).
My reason for wanting worktrees is 3 fold.</p>
<h3><a href="#files-that-could-have-been-gitignored-but-aint" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="files-that-could-have-been-gitignored-but-aint"></a>Files that could have been gitignored but ain't</h3>
<p>I have a <code>.envrc</code> I put in every project, but it's not gitignored for reasons that aren't relevant right now...
If I switch branches I'll stash everything I have at the time, including my .envrc, but then if I forget to pop the stash and I move on and come back then my environment isn't active and I have to go find the stash, pop it, cd out, and then back in and honestly.... that sucks.
Worktrees will let me have the .envrc in every branch, and if I checkout or switch to a new one, my personal branch is unaffected.</p>
<h3><a href="#symlinks" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="symlinks"></a>Symlinks</h3>
<p>In my team's <a href="https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/01_introduction/01_introduction.html">Kedro</a> workflow we keep a specific directory, the <code>conf</code> directory at a different spot than the Kedro team has in their templates (the why is outside the scope here).
The way I preserve every kedro utility for my own benefit is to symlink our <code>conf</code> to where the Kedro template expects it to be.
But then everytime I stash changes I lose that symlink so I either just don't have it for the time being or I recreate it which is a hassle
Worktrees will let me have that present and persistent on all my branches at once.</p>
<h3><a href="#foo" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="foo"></a>Foo</h3>
<p>Because why not!? This workflow feels future-proof, and if my toolset changes down the line then having this worktree centric workflow might be helpful and I'm just prepping for that possibility!</p>
