<p>There a lot of flood stories throughout the history of the world, and the Bible
is no different in this regard. God warns Noah of a de-creation event, whereby
he'll start over with humanity via Noah and his family. Noah survives the flood
by abiding in Yahweh and staying close to the One who loves him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note this reflection doesn't address <em>AT ALL</em> if the flood narrative is a
&quot;real&quot; historical event, whether it's a global or local event, or anything
like that - regardless of those points the Biblical authors used this type of
imagery of chaos waters to communicate themes of judgement and wrath.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus, in the Sermon on the Mount with the 2 houses, calls back to the images
of the chaos waters (the winds and the rains). His instruction is that the wise
man who built his house on the rock will survive, but the foolish man builds
his house on the sand and the winds and the rains destroyed it.</p>
<p>Somewhat obviously this is metaphorical for basing your life on wisdom or
folly. The wisdom is Jesus' teaching which is all based on Yahweh's love for
humanity and his desire to partner with humanity for the good of the whole
earth.</p>
<p>The simple take-away is for us to survive the winds and the rain, and to say it
more fully - to survive de-creation and destruction, we must live our lives in
a way that revolves around Jesus, the perfect human. He calls us to a greater
humanity, an unbroken humanity, which is unachievable apart from him (just look
around if you doubt this truth).</p>
<p>It's important to notice though that abiding in the Lord, basing your life on
the rock, doesn't spare you from the wind and the rain. Trials come, life gets
hard, shit hits the fan. The last few weeks for me haven't been my favorite and
I've certainly experienced turmoil in my life but frankly Jesus makes those
things bearable... in a way I can't put enough words to I'll just be reminded of
Paul in Romans 8...</p>
<pre><code class="language-Romans">worthy to be compared with the glory that is to be revealed to us.” Our present
trials are not on an equal scale with the glory of heaven ```

By God's grace he's molded my heart to be nearly incapable of separating the
Love God has for me from any trial I face - it's not a magic answer or silver
bullet to fixing those problems, and it doesn't make them go away, but I know
the sufferings here aren't even worth comparing to the glory of the Lord. Amen.

<h2><a href="#context" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="context"></a>Context</h2>
<pre><code>24 “Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. 25 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. 26 And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. 27 And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.

<h2><a href="#reflection" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="reflection"></a>Reflection</h2>
<p>From the visual commentary Tim calls out a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>the rock</code> is supposed to first call us back to earlier in the sermon when Jesus calls his people &quot;the light of the world&quot; and says &quot;a city on a hill [mountain] cannot be hidden&quot; (Matthew 5:14). The hill [ὄρος | oros] means &quot;mountain&quot; and is a hyperlink to OT teaching of God's people living in the ideal Jerusalem on Mt. Zion. Lots of Hebrew imagery here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rain and floods are a callback to the Chaos Waters of the OT (and general ANE thinking). It's a reference to the destructive nature that we humans have unleashed on the world - but the wise man who listens to Jesus lives a life with some amount of protection from those hardships - and ultimate protection from God handing us over to Chaos (destruction).</p>

<p>I know there's a lot more to where the texts come from and the varying
traditions in Judaism. But I think at a very high level, Jesus is saying that
we all know, deep down, how to live in harmony but that it requires sacrifice.
He calls us to live sacrificially <em>towards each other</em>, to live in Heaven
today, so we can experience the coming reality if our own resurrection</p>

<pre><code>Why do you see the speck in the eye of your brother, but you don't perceive the
beam in your own eye?

Or how can you say to your brother, &quot;Allow me to take out the speck from your
eye,&quot; and look, the beam is in your eye!

Hypocrite! First take out the beam from your eye, and then you can see clearly
the speck in the eye of your brother.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>Ask and it will be given to you. Seek and you will find. Knock and it will be
hopend to you. For the one who asks will receive, and the one who seeks will
find. And to the one who knocks it will be opened. For what person is among
you, who when their son asks for break, will give him a rock? Or when he asks
for a fish will give him a snake? So then fi you all are bad, but you know how
to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in the
skies give good things to those who ask.

<h2><a href="#reflection" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="reflection"></a>Reflection</h2>
<p>James builds on this with <code>if any of you lacks wisdom then ask for wisdom it will be given to you</code>. James is arming us with some specifics from the Sermon
on the Mount. We aren't just to ask for anything that we think is good...
wisdom is the good we are to ask for.</p>
<p>Tim: Prayer is important because wisdom will flow out of a deep interpersonal
relationship with God.</p>

<li>Marriage/relationships as Kassia and I have navigated many things (job changes, moving for family, family falling through, unhealthy parent relationships, church hunts, and our own self-development and discovery)</li>
<li>He's given me a lot of professional wisdom - potentially through AuDHD and the exposure he's brought me through.</li>
<li>Through Mark Forstrom, Andrew, Nick Z, etc. I was filled with wisdom on how to be a man in the life of a boy - how to talk with someone immature, let them be and feel heard, but also on how to challenge them to grow (up).</li>

<p>This morning I finally felt some motivation for a short Bible Project video. The app is great (💯 would recommend) and gives me daily reminders that are unobtrusive.</p>
<p>The passage is Matthew 7:1-2</p>
<pre><code>Do not judge so tha tyou will not be judged. Because with the judgement that you judge, you will be judged.

And with the measure that you measure, it will be measured to you.
</code></pre>
<p>There are some personal things going on for me as I wrestle and work through an AuDHD diagnosis and there's a lot for me having grown up as a (almost certainly) undiagnosed mild-autistic. These 2 verses are in a larger section of Scripture called &quot;The Sermon on the Mount&quot;, Jesus starts it by basically saying he'll summarize the Law and Prophets in Matthew 5, then concludes it in Matthew 7 by saying he summed them up with what we call the Golden Rule - <code>do unto others as you would have them do unto you</code> is how my Souther Baptist Grandma used to say it.</p>
<p>I've grown up into knowing it's simply silly to expect non-Christians to live Biblically - I do not understand the judgement some Christians throw at non-believers for things like cohabitation or getting drunk... It's literally what I would do without Jesus guiding my lie. However I've always felt a pretty unreasonable responsibility to point out where Christians are living by double standards. Jesus addresses this with another commonly known question - &quot;Why do you take the spec our of your brother's eye but ignore the log in your own eye?&quot;. I'm very personally aware, almost to a hyper degree, but I definitely don't have perfect-awaremenss, and I don't know if I'm losing zeal as I get older or actually growing into wisdom but I am sliding more and more into a position of just not worrying about what other people are doing. As long as my family is safe I'm basically a full-blown libertarian when it comes to people living their lives.</p>
<p>The BP message this morning was just great confirmation that this is directionally correct, at least right now for me. I spent a lot of time as a kid worrying about other Christians living appropriately (this was partly driven by needing older Christians to help me live appropriately and so I felt responsiblity to help provide that environment for myself... combination of God's grace and undiagnosed AuDHD methinks). Now as an adult I spend most of my time thanking Jesus for saving me from myself and I simply trust that he will save who he saves. Because that's not up to me I can focus on what I can manage - my own life and family.</p>

<p>God's kingdom was to be ushered into the world by his creation, but Genesis
3,6,10 tell us that humans choose wrong when we define good and bad by
ourselves. Yahweh chose Abraham and built up Israel as a second attempt of
sorts to bring the his Kingdom to earth but the HB is filled with the story of
how they mostly failed.</p>
<p>NT time is where Jesus reveals the Kingdom to Jews who are oppressed by Roman
Empire and he reveals this to exactly the oppressed audience - &quot;Blessed are the
poor in spirit&quot;</p>

<p>Dragons are metaphorical images in the Bible</p>
<p>Goliath -&gt; armor descriptions
Leviathan</p>
<p>Dragon slayers can be enticed to become dragons themselves</p>
<p>Jesus is the great dragon slayer, who doesn't give in to the inticing power of the dragon</p>
<ul>
<li>calming the sea</li>
<li>conquering sickness in others</li>
<li>tempter in the wilderness</li>
</ul>
<p>Jesus' victory came through the surrender of his life - which brings him deep
into the dragon's realm, to deliver the ultimate blow</p>
<p>Reflect</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the Bible, why is it challenging for humans to slay the dragon? What risks are involved?
The dragon's power is enticing... back to Genesis 3, humans are easy to persuade to do things for personal gain
It's challenging also becauset the dragon is powerful, and humans are not
(without its power or the power of Jesus) so if we stand against it without
the Lord, what hope do we have of victory?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are some of the ways that Jesus confronted the “dragon” in his ministry?</p>
<ul>
<li>calming the sea</li>
<li>conquering sickness in others</li>
<li>tempter in the wilderness</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does Jesus ultimately defeat the “dragon”? How can we follow his example?</p>
<ul>
<li>Surrender</li>
<li>I think we do the same, but it doesn't always look like death, sometimes it's
subverting the temporary authorities we are under to comply in the least
possible ways while always ultimately striving for the coming of the Kingdom</li>
</ul>

<p>!!! scripture &quot;James 5:13-20&quot;</p>
<pre><code>13 Is anyone among you suffering misfortune? He should pray. Is anyone
cheerful? He should sing praise. 14 Is anyone among you sick? He should
summon the elders of the church and they should pray over him, anointing
him with olive oil in the name of the Lord. 15 And the prayer of faith will
save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has
committed sins ⌊he will be forgiven⌋. 16 Therefore confess your sins to one
another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The effective
prayer of a righteous person accomplishes much. 17 Elijah was a human being
with the same nature as us, and ⌊he prayed fervently⌋ for it not to rain,
and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. 18 And he
prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the earth produced its fruit.
19 My brothers, if anyone among you should wander away from the truth and
someone turns him back, 20 he should know that the one who turns a sinner
back from the error of his way will save that person’s soul from death, and
will cover over a great number of sins.

<h3><a href="#when-to-pray" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="when-to-pray"></a>When to pray</h3>
<ol>
<li>All circumstances of life</li>
<li>Sickness</li>
<li>Confession</li>
<li>Working out the will of God</li>
<li>Retrieving wandering souls</li>
</ol>
<p>James ends his letter with prayer because it's an exhortation of the Disapora
and a life of faith must revolve around prayer</p>
<p>For myself I think I pray in all circumstances, sickness, confession all ok. I
do not pray for long periods of time, and don't feel very disiplined, but
whenever anything happens, by the Lord's grace I am quick to turn my
attention to Jesus, and hopefully turn the attention of my wife/kids to Jesus
as well. Example: a person collapsed at the water park we went to this last
weekend, Athalia and I were close-ish to that happening, so I told her we
needed to stop what we were doing and pray that Jesus would intervene.</p>
<p>I confess sin to Jesus but I'm not sure what that <strong>should</strong> look like. I've
taken a Brother Lawrence approach to try and quickly confess and move on,
accepting grace, but I struggle with intentional sinning in this area... What
is prayer if I knew what I was doing was wrong?</p>
<p>I am not more inclined to pray for suffering, but I think that's because I've
very consciously been trying to pray in good circumstances more often because
when we only pray in suffering that turns prayer into a Santa's wish list
situation I think... yes we need the Lord in suffering, but we display our need
for him NOT only in suffering, and if that is true then it begs the question,
to me anyways, of whether or not the need is truly there</p>
<h3><a href="#jc-ryles-quote" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="jc-ryles-quote"></a>JC Ryle's quote</h3>
<p>I disagree with the dude's quote about the requirement of prayer, but only
because the message is given in a direction that makes prayer look like
something I have to do to get/keep/maintain my salvation... Yahweh changes his
children's hearts and orients them towards him through prayer - if someone
doesn't then I think that just means Yahweh has not worked or has not chosen
them, but them calling themselves a Christian is irrelevant, and no amount of
forcing themselves to pray will change Yahweh's will.</p>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Isaiah 1:6&quot;</p>
<pre><code>From the sole of the foot and up to the head
there is no health in it;
bruise and sore and bleeding wound have not been cleansed,
and they have not been bound up
and not softened with the oil.
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Psalm 23:5&quot;</p>
<pre><code>5 You prepare before me a table
in the presence of my oppressors.
You anoint my head with oil;
my cup is overflowing.
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;1 Kings 17:1-16&quot;</p>
<pre><code>17 Elijah the Tishbite from Tishbe of Gilead said to Ahab, “⌊As Yahweh
lives⌋, the God of Israel before whom I stand, there shall surely not be
dew nor rain these years ⌊except by my command⌋.” 2 Then the word of Yahweh
came to him, saying, 3 “Go from this place and turn to the east; you must
hide yourself in the Wadi Kerith ⌊which faces the Jordan⌋. 4 It shall be
that you shall drink from the wadi, and I have commanded the crows to
sustain you there.” 5 So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh.
He went and stayed in the Wadi Kerith ⌊which faces the Jordan⌋. 6 The crows
were bringing bread and meat in the morning for him and bread and meat in
the evening, and he drank from the wadi. 7 It happened ⌊after a while⌋ that
the wadi dried up, because there was no rain in the land.

8 Then the
word of Yahweh came to him, saying, 9 “Get up and go to Zarephath which
belongs to Sidon and stay there. Look, I have commanded a woman there, a
widow, to sustain you.” 10 So he arose and went to Zarephath and came to
the gate of the city. There was a widow woman gathering wood, so he called
to her, and he said, “Please bring a little water for me in a vessel so
that I can drink.” 11 She went to fetch it, and he called to her and said,
“Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.” 12 She said, “⌊As Yahweh
your God lives⌋, surely I do not have a cake, ⌊but only a handful of flour⌋
in the jar and a little olive oil in the jug. Here I am gathering a few
pieces of wood, and I will go and prepare it for me and my son, that we
might eat it and die.” 13 Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go and do
according to your word; only make for me a small bread cake from it first,
and bring it out to me. Make it for yourself and for your son afterward.
14 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘The jar of flour will not be
emptied and the jug of olive oil will not run out until the day Yahweh
gives rain on the surface of the earth.’ ” 15 So she went and did according
to the word of Elijah; then both she and he ate with her household for many
days. 16 The jar of flour was not emptied and the jug of olive oil did not
run out, according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of
Elijah.

<p>This class is not so much a survey of the HB, it is Tim's attempt to distil the
most helpful things for understanding it in a consumable way for laypeople.</p>
<p>A chunk of this is the other people giving some of their own background. One
lady said something that might be helpful for ministry - &quot;Maybe that thing that
I saw as 'you don't love me' is 'I don't know how to love you'&quot;</p>

<p>!!! danger &quot;Christian coping strategy for the Olt Testament&quot;</p>
<pre><code>1. Hero-example model
    * Stories get isolated and distilled down into a simple moral model, where the hero is just the hero.
    * Veggie-Tales is uber-guilty of this nonsense
    * There's something correct about this - but the oversimplification usually comes out of a massive re-writting of the stories, then anyone raised on those versions of the story is scaldalized when they read it for real

2. Poltical-authority source
    * Political parties hijacking &quot;The Bible says X about Y&quot; as a means to harvest authority from a book that many people claim is authoritative.

3. Theology answer book model
    * Treating the Bible like a dictionary of key/value pairs where keys are questions and values are simple answers.
    * This ignores narrative, and general literacy.
    * The instinct may be right - the Bible should profoundly shape my view of everything, but it isn't simple

4. Inspirational-heart-warming model
    * Verse-a-day calendars
    * Jermiah 29:11
</code></pre>
<p>!!! warning &quot;&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Are we imposing a set of questions that are foreign to what the authors are
trying to communicate? do we need to set our cultural agendas aside to just
listen?
</code></pre>
<p>A result of asking the wrong questions is the common story of people's faith being dismantled <em>by reading the Bible</em></p>
<p>!!! note &quot;DL Baker - Two Testaments - One Bible&quot;</p>
<pre><code>One of the most fundamental questions which has faced theology and the
Church in every age... is whether or not Christianity also needs an Old
Testament. Is the Old Testament to be thrown away as obsolete, or pre-
served as a relic from days of yore, or treasured as a classic and read by
scholars, or used occasionally as a change from the New Testament, or
kept in a box in case it should be needed some day? Or is the Old Testa-
ment an essential part of the Christian Bible, with continuing validity along-
side the New Testament? —

<p>The Bible most often refers to itself as <em>the Writings</em></p>
<p>!!! note &quot;Road to Emmaus&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Jesus confronts a couple guys walking to Emmaus after he is resurrected and
more or less calls them idiots/fools for not understanding that the
Writings point to an annointed king who will suffer death for the sake of
redemption. He's recognized by them once their eyes are opened then he vanishes
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Weird stuff</strong></p>
<h3><a href="#paul-and-timothy" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="paul-and-timothy"></a>Paul and Timothy</h3>
<p>Paul assumes when writing to Timothy that he, and probably believers in general, are in a community of people who are regularly learning about Yahweh through the Scriptures <em>as a family</em></p>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;2 Timothy 3:15-16&quot;</p>
<pre><code>... and that from childhood you ahve known the sacred writings which are
able to give you the wisdom that leas to salvation through faith which is
in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for
teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness
</code></pre>
<p>!!! success &quot;&quot;</p>
<pre><code>For Paul, the `Scriptures` here are our OT, the Hebrew Bible. For Paul, the HB
is entirely _wisdom literature_ that leads to salvation through Jesus
</code></pre>
<p>The question of &quot;What are the Scriptures?&quot; is covered in the next session</p>
<p><strong>To answer the question 'How do we read the HB?' we have to ask the question
'Whose book is the HB?'</strong></p>
<h2><a href="#session-3-shape-of-the-scriptures" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="session-3-shape-of-the-scriptures"></a>Session 3: Shape of the Scriptures</h2>
<p><code>Old Testament</code> is the Christian term for a set of writings that comprise about
3/4 of the Christian Bible. The authors themselves though refer to those
writings as <code>the Scriptures</code>. One time it is called <code>the Old Covenant</code> by Paul
, but he's talking about Synagogue readings of the Torah portion in synagogues.
THe phrase <code>Hebrew Bible</code> is a modern term that is a bit more neutral.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, what is our Bible?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Luke 24:25-27&quot;</p>
<pre><code>25 And he said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of
heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! 26 Was it not necessary
that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?”
27 And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in
all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.

<p>!!! scripture &quot;Luke 11:49–51 (ESV) &quot;</p>
<pre><code>49 Therefore also the Wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and
apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,’ 50 so that the blood
of all the prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be charged
against this generation, 51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of
Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell
you, it will be required of this generation.
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would Jesus pick these two events? Abel is murdered on page 4, Zechariah is
murdered in the last part of Chronicles, which in the TaNaK is significant...
Jesus is saying that <em>all the prophets from the beginning of the Scriptures to
the end</em>... All the prophets from A-Z so to speak</p>
<p>!!! note &quot;Scriptures&quot;</p>
<pre><code>&quot;Books&quot; as we know it, bound papers with writing on it, called a 'codex'
wasn't a thing until a couple hundred years post-Jesus... so when the
authors say &quot;The Scriptures&quot; we need to keep in mind that Jews had the
scriptures in their minds and hearts, not on paper (save for a couple very
expensive scrolls). So the structure of the scriptures is also apart of the
Jewish being... This interaction with the Scriptures is _very very very
different than how we interact with the Bible_

<h2><a href="#session-4---seams-between-texts-in-the-dead-sea-scrolls" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="session-4---seams-between-texts-in-the-dead-sea-scrolls"></a>Session 4 - Seams between Texts in the Dead Sea Scrolls</h2>
<p>Around 100-200 AD there was a split in the Jewish community over things like
how the Temple and sacrifices were to be run, etc. A group got kicked out, so
they grabbed some scrolls and went to start what we'd think of as a Monastic
community. Qumran community is where they went, and the scrolls this group
managed are called the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>
<p>Out of DSS we have some of the oldest biblical scrolls, they have their own
writings and liturgies since they were all priests basically too.</p>
<p>The scrolls were hidden in caves before the Romans marched on Qumran. They were
found in the 1940s by a bunch of shepherds. A few showed up online for sale and
that's how we found out about their exitence.... These scrolls give us
pre-Christian Jewish Bible nerds...</p>
<p>Qumran community didn't know about Jesus - they thought the Messiah would be a
man called <em>The Teacher of Righteousness</em></p>
<h3><a href="#scroll-making" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="scroll-making"></a>Scroll-making</h3>
<p>The DSS preserved for us, not only ancient biblical texts, but also the method
by which scrolls were created. They were well-preserved papyrus that was
stiched together - literal stitches. We also have obvious additions from Qumran
community as well as notes from priests and corrections from missed
transcribing.</p>
<h3><a href="#our-bible" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="our-bible"></a>Our Bible</h3>
<p>The DSS scrolls, being the oldest stitched together set of scrolls, teach us
how scrolls and collections of ancient holy texts were put together. We need to
keep this in mind when we think about where our Christian Bible came from</p>
<p>The beginning and ending of our books might/are filled with hyperlinks that
call a reader's mind back to other stories. It's the way of linking context and
stories to one another before the writings are in a codex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hyperlinks - language/syntax that remind a reader of antoher scroll - help us
understand the structure of the Hebrew Bible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>!!! note &quot;A favorite quote from Tim&quot;</p>
<pre><code>So, you can see I'm interested in a historical question of like the
collection [Hebrew Bible] was produced by a group of people. What did they
mean by it? And we can actually know a lot about what they meant and locate
them and read it the way they wanted us to read it, and pick up what
they're saying. And, lo and behold, you know, I hope to convince you
that—and this is all pre-Christian—what's happening here and what this all
points to and means, fits hand in glove with how Jesus and Paul and the
apostles talk about these texts.
So that's different from saying nobody
knew what these texts meant. The events of Jesus happen, and then we go
reread it, and it has a whole new meaning that no one has ever imagined. It
seems to me what actually happened in history was a little more interesting
and complicated than that.  [17:30-18:21]

<h1><a href="#questions" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="questions"></a>Questions</h1>
<p>!!! note &quot;1&quot;</p>
<pre><code>The Hebrew word “emet” is translated with words like “faithful,”
“reliable,” “sure,” “trustworthy,” and “amen.” Read aloud Psalm 36:5-6 ,
Psalm 19:7 , and Psalm 41:13 and discuss what the psalmists are
communicating in these passages when they use the word “emet.”
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Psalms 36:5-6&quot;</p>
<pre><code>5Your lovingkindness, O Lord, extends to the heavens,

Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.

6Your righteousness is like the mountains of God;

Your judgments are like a great deep.

O Lord, You preserve man and beast.
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Psalms 19:7&quot;</p>
<pre><code>7The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul;

The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Psalms 41:13&quot;</p>
<pre><code>13Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,

From everlasting to everlasting.

Amen and Amen.
</code></pre>
<p>I think the lesson here is pretty simple - God is faithful, full stop. His
faithfulness doesn't look necessarily like how we might want... when I was a
kid I would be upset if my parents didn't respond to me in the way I wanted,
and my kids will certainly share that disappointment. But I am faithful to my
children - sometimes the main issue is a child's outlook on a situation or
worldview. I think that metaphor holds true in relation to humans and Yahweh -
he sees the whole world, we see a part of it so we cannot understand
faithfulness fully, in the same way that my children can't understand my
faithfulness to them fully - even to the point of being upset or thinking that
<em>I'm not being faithful</em></p>
<p>!!! note &quot;2&quot;</p>
<pre><code>God promised the Israelites that he would give them a king of peace that
would rule forever and ever (e.g. 2 Samuel 7:16). However, Israel’s kingdom
collapsed and they found themselves without a home or a king. Compare the
beginning of Psalm 89 (vv. 1-10) with the way it closes (vv. 46-52). What
do you think it practically looks like to trust God when all seems lost?

Hebrews 11

The Triumphs of Faith

1Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. 2For by it the men of old gained approval.

3By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible. 4By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks. 5By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; and he was not found because God took him up; for he obtained the witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God. 6And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him. 7By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.

8By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going. 9By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise; 10for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 11By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised. 12Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good as dead at that, as many descendants as the stars of heaven in number, and innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.

13All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. 14For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own. 15And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return. 16But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them.

17By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering up his only begotten son; 18it was he to whom it was said, “In Isaac your descendants shall be called.” 19He considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type. 20By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come. 21By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff. 22By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.

23By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king’s edict. 24By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, 25choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, 26considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward. 27By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen. 28By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. 29By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.

30By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. 31By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies in peace.

32And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, 33who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, 34quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. 35Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection; 36and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment. 37They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated 38(men of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground.

39And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised, 40because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.

Jesus, the Example

1Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

3For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.

. After reading these passages, name one example of what it looks like to put our trust in God.

<h1><a href="#creation" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="creation"></a>Creation</h1>
<p>Brougt to completion on the seventh day in Genesis 1. It is the only day that
does not end with 'there evening and there was morning, the Nth day'</p>
<p>Humans were meant to rest with God in his creation forever, but in their
rebllion they are sentenced to work as slaves to the land. The rest of the
hsitory of God's people consists of them looking for God's rest, but
consistently falling back into slavery/(fallen) work.</p>
<h2><a href="#sabbath" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="sabbath"></a>Sabbath</h2>
<p>Celebated every week on the 7th day. The idea is to live in the eternal rest that God offered in creation.</p>
<h2><a href="#jubilee" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="jubilee"></a>Jubilee</h2>
<p>Every 7 * 7 years is the Ultimate Sabbath - the land is reset (or was supposed
to be), everything was returned to the original owner, debt does not persist -
everything resets so everyone can rest.</p>
<h1><a href="#jesus" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="jesus"></a>Jesus</h1>
<p>Jesus calls himself the Lord of the Sabbath. He claimed to bring the ultimate
rest of God. Jesus was crucified at a specific time - on Good Friday, and he
rose again on the following Sunday... which is the first day of the next week
<em>or</em> the 8th day... the first day of a new age, a new rest, God's ultimate
sabbath that is symbolized in the 7th day of creation.</p>
<h1><a href="#questions" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="questions"></a>Questions</h1>
<p>!!! note &quot;1&quot;</p>
<pre><code>How does the author of Genesis conclude each of the seven days of creation?
Consider the seventh day of creation as an ultimate rest day. What do you
think it would be like to always live in that rest with God?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! Scripture &quot;Genesis 1:5,8,13,19,23,31; 2:1-3 5&quot;</p>
<pre><code>5God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there was
evening and there was morning, one day.

8God called the expanse heaven. And there was evening and there was
morning, a second day.

13There was evening and there was morning, a third day.

19There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.

23There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.

31God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was
evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

The Creation of Man and Woman

1Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. 2By
the seventh day God completed His work which He had done, and He rested on
the seventh day from all His work which He had done. 3Then God blessed the
seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work
which God had created and made.
</code></pre>
<p>I imagine it would've looked a lot like enjoying the creation... I work at
things I love, and that can be restful to me - I find purpose and order in my
hobbies and so I bet life would be like that. The work woudl be productive but
not toilsome.</p>
<p>!!! note &quot;2&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Read Genesis 3:1-7 and 3:21-24 What were the humans tempted to believe
about God and themselves? How did they act on these beliefs, and how did
this choice exile them from the place of rest? How do you think lies about
God and ourselves prevent us from resting with God today?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Genesis 3:1-7,21-24&quot;</p>
<pre><code>The Fall of Man

1Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord
God had made. And he said to the woman, “Indeed, has God said, ‘You shall
not eat from any tree of the garden’?” 2The woman said to the serpent,
“From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; 3but from the fruit
of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall
not eat from it or touch it, or you will die.’ ” 4The serpent said to the
woman, “You surely will not die! 5For God knows that in the day you eat
from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good
and evil.” 6When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it
was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one
wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband
with her, and he ate. 7Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they
knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made
themselves loin coverings. 

21The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam
and his wife, and clothed them. 22Then the Lord God said, “Behold, the man
has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might stretch
out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live
forever”— 23therefore the Lord God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to
cultivate the ground from which he was taken. 24So He drove the man out;
and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the
flaming sword which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of
life.
</code></pre>
<p>Humans are templted to believe that God is witholding desirableble information
they are templted to <em>be like God</em>. They are templted to believe that they
would be right to knowing good and evil (ironic since they know it's bad to eat
of the Tree of Knowledge anyways)</p>
<p>They acted by listening to the serpent, and to themselves... essentially they
chose to not listen and adhere to Yahweh. This choice represents stark and
obvious rebellion. Yahweh, I think, sees that his creation are tempted to go
their own way, and for their own protection exiles them from the Garden.</p>
<p>It seems like lies haven't changed; ultimately we are still tempted to define
good and evil/bad for ourselves. I take action by defining wicked things as
good - made obvious by the fact that I choose to sin often, choose to not
listen to Yahweh. Actively listening to myself is exhausting. I think there's a
lot to discussing &quot;God's rest&quot;, but a high and almost trivial level, I am
simply less tired when my life is more in step with God's definitions of good
and bad</p>
<p>!!! note &quot;3&quot;</p>
<pre><code>God wants to restore humanity to ultimate rest, so he chooses the
Israelites to reenact his seventh-day rest so they can share it with
others. Of all the ways he invites them to practice rest which practice are
you least familiar with today?

<p>!!! scripture &quot;Exodus 20:8-11&quot;</p>
<pre><code>8“Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9Six days you shall labor and
do all your work, 10but the seventh day is a sabbath of the Lord your God;
in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your
male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with
you. 11For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea and
all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the Lord
blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.

<p>!!! scripture &quot;Leviticus 23:1-3; 25:8-13&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Laws of Religious Festivals

1The Lord spoke again to Moses, saying, 2“Speak to the sons of Israel and
say to them, ‘The Lord’s appointed times which you shall proclaim as holy
convocations—My appointed times are these:

3‘For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there is a sabbath
of complete rest, a holy convocation. You shall not do any work; it is a
sabbath to the Lord in all your dwellings.

8‘You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven
times seven years, so that you have the time of the seven sabbaths of
years, namely, forty-nine years. 9You shall then sound a ram’s horn abroad
on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall
sound a horn all through your land. 10You shall thus consecrate the
fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its
inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, and each of you shall return to
his own property, and each of you shall return to his family. 11You shall
have the fiftieth year as a jubilee; you shall not sow, nor reap its
aftergrowth, nor gather in from its untrimmed vines. 12For it is a jubilee;

14And Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about
Him spread through all the surrounding district. 15And He began teaching in
their synagogues and was praised by all.

16And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and as was His
custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read.
17And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. And He opened the
book and found the place where it was written,

18“The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me,

Because He anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor.

He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives,

And recovery of sight to the blind,

To set free those who are oppressed,

19To proclaim the favorable year of the Lord.”

20And He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant and sat down; and
the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him. 21And He began to say
to them, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Leviticus 25&quot;</p>
<pre><code>The Sabbatic Year and Year of Jubilee

1The Lord then spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, saying, 2“Speak to the sons
of Israel and say to them, ‘When you come into the land which I shall give
you, then the land shall have a sabbath to the Lord. 3Six years you shall
sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in
its crop, 4but during the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath rest,
a sabbath to the Lord; you shall not sow your field nor prune your
vineyard. 5Your harvest’s aftergrowth you shall not reap, and your grapes
of untrimmed vines you shall not gather; the land shall have a sabbatical
year. 6All of you shall have the sabbath products of the land for food;
yourself, and your male and female slaves, and your hired man and your
foreign resident, those who live as aliens with you. 7Even your cattle and
the animals that are in your land shall have all its crops to eat.

8‘You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven
times seven years, so that you have the time of the seven sabbaths of
years, namely, forty-nine years. 9You shall then sound a ram’s horn abroad
on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall
sound a horn all through your land. 10You shall thus consecrate the
fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its
inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, and each of you shall return to
his own property, and each of you shall return to his family. 11You shall
have the fiftieth year as a jubilee; you shall not sow, nor reap its
aftergrowth, nor gather in from its untrimmed vines. 12For it is a jubilee;
it shall be holy to you. You shall eat its crops out of the field.

13‘On this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his own property.
14If you make a sale, moreover, to your friend or buy from your friend’s
hand, you shall not wrong one another. 15Corresponding to the number of
years after the jubilee, you shall buy from your friend; he is to sell to
you according to the number of years of crops. 16In proportion to the
extent of the years you shall increase its price, and in proportion to the
fewness of the years you shall diminish its price, for it is a number of
crops he is selling to you. 17So you shall not wrong one another, but you
shall fear your God; for I am the Lord your God.

18‘You shall thus observe My statutes and keep My judgments, so as to carry
them out, that you may live securely on the land. 19Then the land will
yield its produce, so that you can eat your fill and live securely on it.
20But if you say, “What are we going to eat on the seventh year if we do
not sow or gather in our crops?” 21then I will so order My blessing for you
in the sixth year that it will bring forth the crop for three years. 22When
you are sowing the eighth year, you can still eat old things from the crop,
eating the old until the ninth year when its crop comes in.

The Law of Redemption

23‘The land, moreover, shall not be sold permanently, for the land is Mine;
for you are but aliens and sojourners with Me. 24Thus for every piece of
your property, you are to provide for the redemption of the land.

25‘If a fellow countryman of yours becomes so poor he has to sell part of
his property, then his nearest kinsman is to come and buy back what his
relative has sold. 26Or in case a man has no kinsman, but so recovers his
means as to find sufficient for its redemption, 27then he shall calculate
the years since its sale and refund the balance to the man to whom he sold
it, and so return to his property. 28But if he has not found sufficient
means to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the
hands of its purchaser until the year of jubilee; but at the jubilee it
shall revert, that he may return to his property.

29‘Likewise, if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then his
redemption right remains valid until a full year from its sale; his right
of redemption lasts a full year. 30But if it is not bought back for him
within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city
passes permanently to its purchaser throughout his generations; it does not
revert in the jubilee. 31The houses of the villages, however, which have no
surrounding wall shall be considered as open fields; they have redemption
rights and revert in the jubilee. 32As for cities of the Levites, the
Levites have a permanent right of redemption for the houses of the cities
which are their possession. 33What, therefore, belongs to the Levites may
be redeemed and a house sale in the city of this possession reverts in the
jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession
among the sons of Israel. 34But pasture fields of their cities shall not be
sold, for that is their perpetual possession.

Of Poor Countrymen

35‘Now in case a countryman of yours becomes poor and his means with regard
to you falter, then you are to sustain him, like a stranger or a sojourner,
that he may live with you. 36Do not take usurious interest from him, but
revere your God, that your countryman may live with you. 37You shall not
give him your silver at interest, nor your food for gain. 38I am the Lord
your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of
Canaan and to be your God.

39‘If a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he
sells himself to you, you shall not subject him to a slave’s service. 40He
shall be with you as a hired man, as if he were a sojourner; he shall serve
with you until the year of jubilee. 41He shall then go out from you, he and
his sons with him, and shall go back to his family, that he may return to
the property of his forefathers. 42For they are My servants whom I brought
out from the land of Egypt; they are not to be sold in a slave sale. 43You
shall not rule over him with severity, but are to revere your God. 44As for
your male and female slaves whom you may have—you may acquire male and
female slaves from the pagan nations that are around you. 45Then, too, it
is out of the sons of the sojourners who live as aliens among you that you
may gain acquisition, and out of their families who are with you, whom they
will have produced in your land; they also may become your possession.
46You may even bequeath them to your sons after you, to receive as a
possession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to your
countrymen, the sons of Israel, you shall not rule with severity over one
another.

Of Redeeming a Poor Man

47‘Now if the means of a stranger or of a sojourner with you becomes
sufficient, and a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to him as
to sell himself to a stranger who is sojourning with you, or to the
descendants of a stranger’s family, 48then he shall have redemption right
after he has been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him, 49or his uncle,
or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives from his
family may redeem him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself. 50He then
with his purchaser shall calculate from the year when he sold himself to
him up to the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall correspond
to the number of years. It is like the days of a hired man that he shall be
with him. 51If there are still many years, he shall refund part of his
purchase price in proportion to them for his own redemption; 52and if few
years remain until the year of jubilee, he shall so calculate with him. In
proportion to his years he is to refund the amount for his redemption.
53Like a man hired year by year he shall be with him; he shall not rule
over him with severity in your sight. 54Even if he is not redeemed by these
means, he shall still go out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with
him. 55For the sons of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom I
brought out from the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.

<p>Paul says he chooses joy when he is in jail</p>
<p>!!! note &quot;&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Joy is a _choice_
</code></pre>
<p>2 Corinthians 6:10 -&gt; Paul is filled with sorrow and yet rejoicing</p>
<p>!!! success &quot;&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Christian joy is rooted in future hope and expectation of a Messiah, of
Jesus, to come again. It is a profound choice, not the result of current
circumstances
</code></pre>
<h1><a href="#questions" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="questions"></a>Questions</h1>
<p>!!! note &quot;1&quot;</p>
<pre><code>The Israelites choose a path apart from God. As a result, they get exiled
from their land and dominated by foreign nations. But the prophet Isaiah
knew that sorrow would not have the final word with these people. He looked
forward to the day when Yahweh would end pain and corruption to lead them
into endless, joyful living. Read Isaiah 49:13 and Isaiah 51:11 . What does
Isaiah tell us about God’s character in these passages? What does Isaiah
say will happen to God’s people?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Isaiah 49:13&quot;</p>
<pre><code>13Shout for joy, O heavens! And rejoice, O earth!

Break forth into joyful shouting, O mountains!

For the Lord has comforted His people

And will have compassion on His afflicted.
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Isaiah 51:11&quot;</p>
<pre><code>11So the ransomed of the Lord will return

And come with joyful shouting to Zion,

And everlasting joy will be on their heads.

They will obtain gladness and joy,

And sorrow and sighing will flee away.
</code></pre>
<p>Isiah tells us that God is good and faithful. He mentions God's past
faithfulness - <code>For the Lord _has_ comforted His people</code> as well as future
faithfulness - <code>So the randomed of the Lord _will_ return...</code></p>
<p>Isiah leans in on Yahweh's defining nature from Exodus 34:6. God's <code>hesed</code>, his
<strong>steadfase love</strong>, is what is our hope. Otherwise our God is no different than
any powerful but fickle diety.</p>
<p>Isiah also doesn't, in these short passages, promise or claim a promise of any
kind of temporal happiness - the joy is historical-facing in reflecting on
God's deliverance and future-facing inr reflecting also on God's deliverance.
God's people were still supposed to find this joy in the midst of their bondage.</p>
<p>!!! note &quot;2&quot;</p>
<pre><code>The prophet Isaiah looked forward to the coming of Israel’s redeemer. His
prophecies were fulfilled with the arrival of Jesus. Read Luke 2:9-11 . Why
were the shepherds afraid? What reasons did the angels give for them to
rejoice instead?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Luke 2:9-11&quot;</p>
<pre><code>9And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the
Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened. 10But the angel
said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great
joy which will be for all the people; 11for today in the city of David
there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.
</code></pre>
<p>Presumably the shepherds were afraid because of <code>the glory of the Lord</code>. All
throughout the OT we have examples of God's people fearing this glory,
specifically on Sinai. Yahweh even tells Moses that he can only be shown
Yahweh's back due to his glory, and then Moses has to veil his face so that the
glory of the Lord persisted on him would not terrify the Israelites.</p>
<p>The angels outright said that a Savior has been born, the Messiah has come.
There is no greater cause for joy than the king of creation returning</p>
<p>!!! note &quot;3&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Joy can persist in the harshest of circumstances because it depends on God
and his promises. Read Matthew 5:11-12 , Acts 13:50-52 , and Hebrews 12:1-3
. According to these passages, what specific truths about God can sustain
joy even through painful or dire situations?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! success &quot;&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Joy can persist in the harshest of circumstances because it depends on God
and his promises.
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Matthew 5:11-12&quot;</p>
<pre><code>11“Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely
say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. 12Rejoice and be glad, for
your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the
prophets who were before you.

<p>!!! scripture &quot;Acts 13:50-52&quot;</p>
<pre><code>50But the Jews incited the devout women of prominence and the leading men
of the city, and instigated a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and
drove them out of their district. 51But they shook off the dust of their
feet in protest against them and went to Iconium. 52And the disciples were
continually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.

<p>!!! scripture &quot;Hebrews 12:1-3&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Jesus, the Example

1Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let
us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles

consequences for us in the modern age, but obviously not in God's age that's
already here and yet coming.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Holy Spirit gives us joy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have long list of people in history who lived faithful lives, struggled
with God, experienced pain, and yet were faithful the Lord by God's own
grace. Similarly we are chosen and favored - the receipients of God's
<code>hesed</code> love.</p>
</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>!!! note &quot;4&quot;</p>
<pre><code>When we see how Jesus’ loving way of life has overcome death itself, joy
starts to become strangely reasonable. But this doesn’t mean it is wise to
ignore or suppress sorrow. Read 2 Corinthians 6:3-10 . How did Paul
integrate both joy and sorrow?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;2 Corinthians 6:3-10&quot;</p>
<pre><code>3giving no cause for offense in anything, so that the ministry will not be
discredited, 4but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God, in
much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses, 5in beatings,
in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hunger, 6in
purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in
genuine love, 7in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the weapons of
righteousness for the right hand and the left, 8by glory and dishonor, by
evil report and good report; regarded as deceivers and yet true; 9as
unknown yet well-known, as dying yet behold, we live; as punished yet not
put to death, 10as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many
rich, as having nothing yet possessing all things.

<h2><a href="#priests" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="priests"></a>Priests</h2>
<p>God creates Eden in which he places humans to be his royal image - priests. God
sets humans up to receive his blessing but humans choose their own way. The
promise is for a priest and a sacrifice to come in Jesus.</p>
<p>God chooses Abraham and Sarah as the first royal priesthood as they are chosen
by God to bless all the nations.</p>
<h2><a href="#melchizedek" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="melchizedek"></a>Melchizedek</h2>
<p>A priestly king of Salem. Melchizedek recognizes Yahweh as the God of gods -
Abraham tithes to him and that's about the end of the story</p>
<p>Salem is ancient short name for Jerusalem.
Abraham's tithe to Melchizedek is just like the Israelite call to tithe to the
Levites (priests) to support them.</p>
<h2><a href="#royal-family" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="royal-family"></a>Royal Family</h2>
<p>Abraham and Sarah are promised their own children but they take amtters into
their own hands by scheming with Hagar. Eventually Sarah is given her own son,
Issac, who God then calls for his life as a test of Abraham - it represents God
challenging Abraham to trust him with his own promise, and to not go his own
way with Sarah</p>
<p>DUring the Isaac sacrifice narrative a ram is given in place and Abraham names the place &quot;God will provide&quot;.</p>
<h2><a href="#types" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="types"></a>Types</h2>
<p>The story of God's call to sacrifice Isaac is much like the story of Abraham
meeting Melchizedek. In the Melchizedek story Abraham meets a priest on a high
place and gives him an offering. In the Isaac story Abraham acts as the priest
and a ram is given to him by the LORD that covers the sins of Abraham's family.</p>
<p>!!! note &quot;Atonement and Covering&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Covering the sin in this case looks much more like redemption and resolve
rather than payment for gult, similar to a small-scale apology can cover a
grievance even though no payment is made to make anything 'right', the
'covering' is simply a sign of forgiveness

<pre><code>Shalem, or Salem, is later known as Jerusalem. Moriah, a mountainous region in
Jerusalem, is later called the “mount of the LORD” (Genesis 22:14) and the
“temple mount” (2 Chronicles 3:1). With all of this in mind, compare Genesis
14:17-20 with Genesis 22:1-14 . How do you see God providing for Abraham in

Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley). 18And Melchizedek king of Salem
brought out bread and wine; now he was a priest of God Most High. 19He
blessed him and said,

“Blessed be Abram of God Most High,

Possessor of heaven and earth;

20And blessed be God Most High,

Who has delivered your enemies into your hand.”

He gave him a tenth of all.

<pre><code>The Offering of Isaac

1Now it came about after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to
him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 2He said, “Take now your son,
your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and
offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will
tell you.” 3So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey,
and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son; and he split wood
for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had
told him. 4On the third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from
a distance. 5Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey, and
I and the lad will go over there; and we will worship and return to you.”
6Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son,
and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked
on together. 7Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “My father!” And
he said, “Here I am, my son.” And he said, “Behold, the fire and the wood,
but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” 8Abraham said, “God will
provide for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” So the two of
them walked on together. 

9Then they came to the place of which God had told
him; and Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood, and bound his
son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. 10Abraham
stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. 11But the angel
of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he
said, “Here I am.” 12He said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the
lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you
have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.” 13Then Abraham raised
his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by
his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt
offering in the place of his son. 14Abraham called the name of that place
The Lord Will Provide, as it is said to this day, “In the mount of the Lord
it will be provided.”

<p>!!! note &quot;3&quot;</p>
<pre><code>As you review Hebrews 7 , notice how the author assures their audience that
Jesus is better than any other priest. What are some of the reasons the
author provides? How is this good news for everyone?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Hebrews 7&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Melchizedek’s Priesthood Like Christ’s

1For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 2to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils, was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace. 3Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.

4Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils. 5And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham. 6But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises. 7But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. 8In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives on. 9And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes, 10for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.

11Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron? 12For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also. 13For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar. 14For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. 15And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek, 16who has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life. 17For it is attested of Him,

“You are a priest forever

According to the order of Melchizedek.”

18For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness 19(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God. 20And inasmuch as it was not without an oath 21(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him,

“The Lord has sworn

And will not change His mind,

‘You are a priest forever’ ”);

22so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.

23The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing, 24but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently. 25Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.

26For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens; 27who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself. 28For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever.
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>Melchizedek was &quot;king of righteousness&quot; and &quot;kind of peace&quot;, Jesus is a priest according to &quot;the order of Melchizedek&quot; and so seems to be that Jesus is the continued reigning king of righteousness and peace</li>
<li>Melchizedek was priest of God Most High - the priestly order changed to Levi with the giving of the Law... Jesus represents, and <em>is</em>, another change in the priesthood which necessitates another change in law (verse 12). Jesus' kingship and priesthood is more similar to Melchizek's than Levi's (who was no king anyways).</li>
<li>Levitical priesthood was not bound by an oath - but Jesus' priesthood is bound by Yahweh's oath to not change his mind, Jesus is priest forever</li>
<li>Former priests, Levites, changed due to death, but Jesus persists forever (Melchizedek also presumably died)</li>

<h1><a href="#video" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="video"></a>Video</h1>
<h2><a href="#eden" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="eden"></a>Eden</h2>
<p>Biblical story begins in a garden, which is presented as a type of Temple. The
top (center) is the Tree of Life, which represents God's life and creative
power. Humans <strong>were supposed to eat from the Tree of Life</strong> but there's
another tree, the Tree of Knowledge of &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; which represents
assuming the authority to define good and bad for one's own life rather than
trusting God's defintion. Human eat of that tree and are thus exiled from the
garden.</p>
<h2><a href="#burning-bush" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="burning-bush"></a>Burning Bush</h2>
<p>Moses meets God at a burning tree, a plant on a mountain radiating with God's
power just like the Tree of Life. Yahweh charges Moses to bring the same choice
to the Israelites that Adam and Eve had, which is to trust God or define
morality for themselves.</p>
<h2><a href="#jesus" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="jesus"></a>Jesus</h2>
<p>Jesus announced that God's eternal life is available through him now -
originally in Eden given through the Tree of Life. Jesus invites other people
to &quot;eat of him&quot; to be transformed by God's own life. The invitation is the same</p>
<ul>
<li>to trust Yahweh or not. But Jesus' life exposes humanity's brokenness in that
humans crucified him. Jesus is hung on a cross (a tree) on the top of a
hill (like Mt. Sinai) and humans not only eat of a different false tree of
life, but they chopped down the real Tree of Life - Jesus.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a href="#questions" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="questions"></a>Questions</h1>
<p>!!! note &quot;1&quot;</p>
<pre><code>    What is one practical example of what it means to eat from the tree of
    life? How is it different from eating from the false tree of life?
</code></pre>
<p>Giving money away I think is one practical example of eating from the tree of
life. Jesus calls us to share our blessings, and choosing to live by his
authority rather than decide for myself what to do with my money (meaning to
spend it on my desires only rather than invest in the Kingdom) then I make the
same choice humanity always makes - to not trust God's definition of good and
bad</p>
<p>!!! note &quot;2&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Compare John 15:5-13
with Matthew 7:15-20
. How does the true vine give life? How do we recognize a false tree of life?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;John 15:5-13&quot;</p>
<pre><code>5I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he
bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing. 6If anyone does not
abide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up; and they gather
them, and cast them into the fire and they are burned. 7If you abide in Me,
and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for
you. 8My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, and so
prove to be My disciples. 9Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also
loved you; abide in My love. 10If you keep My commandments, you will abide
in My love; just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His
love. 11These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and
that your joy may be made full. Disciples’ Relation to Each Other 12“This
is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you.
13Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his
friends.
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Matthew 7:15-20&quot;</p>
<pre><code>15“Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but
inwardly are ravenous wolves. 16You will know them by their fruits. Grapes
are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they? 17So
every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. 18A
good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
19Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the
fire. 20So then, you will know them by their fruits.
</code></pre>
<p>The true vine gives life through communion and connection. Jesus says to &quot;abide
in [him]&quot; which is represented by a choice to believe him about kingdom, love,
relationships, brokenness, etc... By meditating on the Word of God, communing
with Jesus, being washed and guided by the Spirit we are transformed more and more into
the image of Jesus which is real and true life.</p>
<p>!!! note &quot;3&quot;</p>
<pre><code>What are some examples of good fruit and bad fruit (see Galatians 5:16-25)?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Galations 5:16-25&quot;</p>
<pre><code>16But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of
the flesh. 17For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the
Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so
that you may not do the things that you please. 18But if you are led by the
Spirit, you are not under the Law. 19Now the deeds of the flesh are
evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, 20idolatry, sorcery,
enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions,
factions, 21envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of
which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who
practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 22But the fruit
of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
faithfulness, 23gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no
law. 24Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with
its passions and desires. 25If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by
the Spirit.
</code></pre>
<p>Good fruit:</p>
<pre><code>- choosing to guard my eyes and thoughts against sexual immorality
- remaining calm when things aren't going my way at work
- drinking water instead of _another_ drink at night
- giving money away out of love
- seeking unity and charity especially in any time of conflict
</code></pre>
<p>Bad fruit:</p>
<pre><code>- outbursts at work - for me this is basically giving up hope for someone to be successful. By God's grace I have a desire to help peopl learn and succeed, but I can exhaust that desire and instead of prioritize an individual's well-being/growth I place my frustration above that and let my annoyance guide me more than a spirit of teaching and gentleness
- having that second, or third, drink 
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are led byt he Spirit, you are not under the Law... This isn't saying
that the Law doesn't apply, but that by the Spirit's guidance we will never
be found guilty by anything in the Law!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>!!! note &quot;4&quot;</p>
<pre><code>When Jesus talks about what his death will accomplish, he talks about a
seed going into the ground before it bears fruit (see John 12:23-26). What
could it look like to live in the ways of Jesus and bear the fruit of life?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;John 12:23-26&quot;</p>
<pre><code>23And Jesus *answered them, saying, “The hour has come for the Son of Man
to be glorified. 24Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat
falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears
much fruit. 25He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in
this world will keep it to life eternal. 26If anyone serves Me, he must
follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also; if anyone serves
Me, the Father will honor him.
</code></pre>
<p>Meditating on God's faithfulness to humanity in spite of our disobedience I
think is an avenue by which the Spirit changes our hearts and as we are changed
by him we live lives that reflect Jesus' own life</p>
<p>I think there can be many facets to the seed dying aspect, one relevant piece
seems fairly self-evident in the passage... if we hold onto our life (ie. be a
seed that never dies) then we will never flourish, but if we give up the life
we have now and live like Jesus did, we will blessed with life</p>

<p>Words that stick out:

<p>!!! note &quot;2&quot;</p>
<pre><code>The prophet Isaiah looked forward to the arrival of the Prince of Peace, whose
reign would lead to eternal shalom. Jesus’ arrival fulfilled Isaiah’s words.
Read and reflect on Luke 2:9-15 as a group. Why do you think God announced the
King’s arrival to no-name shepherds? What does this tell you about the nature
of God and his Kingdom?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Luke 2:9-15&quot;</p>
<pre><code>9And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the
Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened. 10But the angel
said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great
joy which will be for all the people; 11for today in the city of David
there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 12This will
be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a
manger.” 13And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the
heavenly host praising God and saying,

14“Glory to God in the highest,

And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased.”

15When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds began
saying to one another, “Let us go straight to Bethlehem then, and see this
thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us.”
</code></pre>
<p>At thsi point it seems obvious that the reason God came to the undesirable
company of teh time was to illustrate that the Kingdom of Heaven was to be an
upside down kingdom. Status and power are hinderences under Jesus' reign, so he
builds his kingdom (from our perspective) from the ground up.</p>
<p>!!! note &quot;3&quot;</p>
<pre><code>The biblical story shows how humanity often chooses a way of life apart
from God and suffers as a result. According to Colossians 1:19-23 , what
did God want to do to remedy this pain, and how did he accomplish his
desire through Jesus?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture</p>
<pre><code>Colossians 1:19-23

19For it was the Father’s good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in
Him, 20and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made
peace (εἰρηνοποιέω) through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things on
earth or things in heaven.

21And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in
evil deeds, 22yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through
death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond
reproach— 23if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and
steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have
heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I,
Paul, was made a minister.
</code></pre>
<p>God interacted with Creation as a created being himself, holding back
<em>something</em> in the person of Jesus. On our turf, God showed up to revive our
lifeless souls and call us to live as citizens in his kingdom.</p>
<p>!!! note &quot;4&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Jesus offers his peace to all people as a gift. Read Ephesians 2:11-16 .
How did Jesus make peace between two sharply divided people groups (Jews
and Gentiles), and why did he do it (see Eph. 2:16)?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Ephesians 2:11-16&quot;</p>
<pre><code>11Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are
called “Uncircumcision” by the so-called “Circumcision,” which is performed
in the flesh by human hands— 12remember that you were at that time separate
from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the
covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 13But
now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by
the blood of Christ. 14For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups
into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, 15by abolishing
in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in
ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus
establishing peace, 

16and might reconcile them both in one body to God
through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.
</code></pre>
<p>Jesus broke down the dividing wall of Circumcision by fulfilling Torah. No
longer do the people of God need to be circumcized into the covenant (we have
baptism), and no longer are God's people separate from the world via outward
appearances but instead by living lives loyal to a different God - to Yahweh</p>
<p>!!! success &quot;&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Jesus &quot;put to death the enmity&quot; by removing all *spiritually/covenantally relevant* barriers that separated Jews from Gentiles
</code></pre>
<p>!!! note &quot;5&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Now, let’s carefully read Ephesians 4:1-3 How can humility, gentleness,
patience, and love help maintain the unity Jesus calls his followers to?
What happens to unity when one of these virtues is missing?
</code></pre>
<p>!!! scripture &quot;Ephesians 4:1-3&quot;</p>
<pre><code>1Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner
worthy of the calling with which you have been called, 2with all humility
and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,
3being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
</code></pre>
<p>These things don't just help maintain unity - they are the postures of life
Jesus builds his Kingdom around (second to himself I suppose). Jesus levels the
playing field for all people, and no one has anymore right to anything than
anyone else. Things like humility (right view of oneself), gentleness,
patience, love, etc. are necessary for Jesus' kingdom to look how he wants it
to look</p>
