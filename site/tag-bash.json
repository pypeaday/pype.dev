But I had a ton of snapshots of\nchild datasets with a ton of data that I just never will need, so I learned\n<code>zfs list -H -o name -t snapshot tank/dataset1/dataset2</code> will list just the\nsnapshots for dataset2 and if you pipe that into <code>xargs -n1 zfs destroy</code> then\nyou have a way to clear out some snapshots you don't need!</p>\n<!-- Content Injected to every content markdown footer -->\n",
