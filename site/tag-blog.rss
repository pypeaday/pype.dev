<p>I woke up to faulty internet and after some troubleshooting it turns out the
root zfs dataset that OPNSense boots from got corrupted...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PRO-TIP - Auto backup your OPNSense config to Google Drive, git, or
nextcloud... But if you won't then at least back up your OPNSense config
somewhere everytime you update it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's too much to recount every issue, so here's a bullet list what worked.</p>
<ol>
<li>On a fresh drive install OPNSense</li>
<li>Plug in the old drive through a USB enclosure - now I'm not sure what would
happen if you plugged it in along with the new drive and then booted up.
Because both drives will have a zfs pool <code>zroot</code> and the boot dataset is
automounted at <code>/zroot/ROOT/default</code>. My old <code>zroot</code> pool was <code>SUSPENDED</code> so it
didn't automount</li>
<li>Because the old <code>zoot/ROOT/default</code> was corrupted I did this to mount it RO:
<code>zpool import -d &lt;path to zfs partition - /dev/stuff&gt; -N zroot zrootrecovery</code></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>-d is the zfs flag to import the pool by disk id, -N it to not mount any of
the datasets (we need to change mountpoints) and the <code>zroot zrootrecovery</code>
imports the <code>zroot</code> pool with a new name</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li>Change the mountpoints for all the <code>zrootrecovery</code> datasets to somewhere
like <code>/mnt/zrootrecovery</code></li>
<li>Depending on the mount point you set you'll find a <code>config</code> directory around
<code>/mnt/zrootrecovery/ROOT/default/config</code> - copy the file you want to another
machine via scp or whatever</li>
<li>Go to OPNSense webui and recover from that config!</li>
</ol>
<p>All in all this process took me around 8 hours but I did run into about ever
issue under the sun (several bad disks in the mix, a laptop that wouldn't live
boot into a BSD system, etc.)</p>

<p>Amazon has crossed the line with me just one too many times now so we are looking to drop them like every other Big Tech provider....</p>
<p>However, one key feature of Amazon that has been so useful for us is Lists... We can just maintain a list for each of us and then family members can login anytime and check it out...
This really alleviates any last minute gift idea stress right before a birthday or something.</p>
<p>So I need a nice gift list service but I don't want to be locked into one company (like a Target registry or something) and I'd like to host it myself</p>
<p>The internets had a few options but nothing looked/felt like I wanted to I decided to build my own.</p>
<h1><a href="#the-frontend" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="the-frontend"></a>The Frontend</h1>
<p><u>I have no idea how to do front end so stay tuned</u></p>
<h1><a href="#the-backend" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="the-backend"></a>The Backend</h1>
<p>FastAPI for the win on this one... I followed a few examples online and what I was able to build in just a few minutes is pretty impressive thanks to the design of FastAPI.</p>
<p>Some key features are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Auto doc generation</li>
<li>Required typing (which makes #1 possible)</li>
<li>Built-in api testing in the browser</li>
<li>Easy integration with sqlalchemy</li>
<li>Development time so short you won't be done with your coffee before having something up and running!</li>
</ol>
<h2><a href="#database" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="database"></a>Database</h2>
<p>Starting with a simple <code>database.py</code> we can create a sqlalchemy session with a base model with about 7 lines of code...</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker


SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = &quot;sqlite:///wishes.sqlite3&quot;
engine = create_engine(SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL)
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
Base = declarative_base()
</code></pre>
<h2><a href="#model" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="model"></a>Model</h2>
<p>For my wish list I needed just a simple table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th align="right">id</th>
<th align="left">person</th>
<th align="left">item</th>
<th align="left">link</th>
<th align="left">purchased</th>
<th align="left">purchased_by</th>
<th align="left">date_added</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td align="right">1</td>
<td align="left">pypeaday</td>
<td align="left">A sweet item</td>
<td align="left"><a href="http://www.mystore.store">www.mystore.store</a></td>
<td align="left">False</td>
<td align="left">dad</td>
<td align="left">2022-05-05 21:55:09</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="right">2</td>
<td align="left">pypeaday</td>
<td align="left">A bitter item</td>
<td align="left"><a href="http://www.bitterstore.com">www.bitterstore.com</a></td>
<td align="left">True</td>
<td align="left">Mrs. pypeaday</td>
<td align="left">2022-05-06 06:55:54</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The table is simple enough... A unique key, the person who the wish belongs to, the item (or wish), a link to the item, whether it's been purchased or not and by whom, and the date it was added.</p>
<p>To make this model with sqlalchemy we can make a <code>model.py</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from database import Base
from sqlalchemy.schema import Column
from sqlalchemy.types import Boolean, Integer, String, Text


class Wishes(Base):
    __tablename__ = &quot;Wishes&quot;
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    person = Column(String(20))
    item = Column(Text())
    link = Column(Text())
    purchased = Column(Boolean())
    purchased_by = Column(String(90))
    date_added = Column(String(15))
</code></pre>
<h2><a href="#schema" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="schema"></a>Schema</h2>
<p>One of the best things about FastAPI is trivial integration with pydantic.
We can define a schema to ensure any data posted is not missing anything!</p>
<p>Make a <code>schema.py</code> with the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from pydantic import BaseModel
import time
from typing import Optional


class wish_schema(BaseModel):

    person: str
    item: str
    link: str
    purchased: bool = False
    purchased_by: Optional[str] = None
    date_added: Optional[str] = time.strftime(&quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;, time.localtime())

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True


class patch_schema(BaseModel):

    purchased: bool
    purchased_by: Optional[str] = None

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True

</code></pre>
<p>I have 2 schemas - one for a <code>wish</code> which you'll see down below is used to validate any <code>post</code> requests.</p>
<p>To simplify things for me I made another schema, <code>patch_schema</code> which I use for the route that updates the table (ie. marking an existing wish as purchased)</p>
<h2><a href="#session" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="session"></a>Session</h2>
<p>One of the last things we need is a Session</p>
<p>So make a <code>session.py</code>...</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">from database import SessionLocal, engine
import model

model.Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)


def create_get_session():
    try:
        db = SessionLocal()
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()
</code></pre>
<p>Our routes will depend on this <code>create_get_session</code> function that will yield a <code>db</code> object through which we'll udpate our database</p>
<h1><a href="#ok-just-do-it-already" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="ok-just-do-it-already"></a>Ok just do it already!</h1>
<p>So our <code>main.py</code> will have a few routes in it...</p>
<p>What do we want to support?</p>
<ol>
<li>Getting all wishes</li>
<li>Getting a specific wish</li>
<li>Updating a specific wish</li>
<li>Deleting a wish</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the script is fairly self explanatory but here's a few notes...</p>
<ol>
<li>We decorate each function with <code>@app.&lt;method&gt;</code> and define <code>response_model</code> as well as <code>status_code</code></li>
<li>The functions are defined with <code>async</code> (this was my first exposure to this so I can't go in depth on it yet)</li>
<li>The functions all take a <code>db</code> which is from <code>session.py</code> and that <code>db</code> depends on the <code>create_get_session</code> function</li>
<li>If the db is being updtes then we type the object used for the update with the appropriate schema (either <code>wish_schema</code> or <code>patch_schema</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>From there we're in true python-land where you can basically guess the methods on <code>db</code> and you'd probably be right... (like <code>query</code>, <code>upddate</code>, <code>delete</code> etc.)</p>

<p>My current homelab setup is not great but it works...</p>
<h1><a href="#proxmox-on-poweredge-r610" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="proxmox-on-poweredge-r610"></a>Proxmox on PowerEdge R610</h1>
<p>I boot off an SD card and have 1 SSD and 5 HDDs configured as a JBOD array using a Dell H700 SAS controller.
I cannot boot from a disk using this controller and I can't get the firmware configured in a way to allow it.
So I have 1 SSD as a ZFS array that I've been putting my VM images on, and the 5 HDDs are passed through to a TrueNAS VM where I handle all the ZFS stuff there... kind of meta because I then attached those drives to Proxmox as a CIFS share.</p>
<h1><a href="#truenas-on-dedicated-box" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="truenas-on-dedicated-box"></a>TrueNAS on dedicated box</h1>
<p>I have an on-prem backup that is just an old desktop running TrueNAS
I regularly backup the 5 disk RAIDZ2 array from my Proxmox host (managed by a TrueNAS VM) to this backup box</p>
<p>Currently there is nothing else running on this machine since it's my &quot;backup&quot;</p>
<h1><a href="#jellyfin" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" id="jellyfin"></a>Jellyfin</h1>
<p>I was HWA for Jellyfin, but hardware passthrough on the R610 is finicky or broken so Jellyfin is running on an Ubuntu host.</p>
<p>I could put UBuntu on the R610 and give up &quot;true virtualization&quot;. Then I'd manage the SMB share myself.
If I do that then I would get rid of &quot;users&quot; I think, ie. basically forgo least-priviledges since I'm not sure how hard that is to manage.</p>
<p>On the other hand, direct access to the smb config might make it easier?</p>
<p>I have the media array on Jellyfin box setup as NFS which was really easy with ZFS... I think SMB would be just as easy.</p>

<p>Olivet bible stuff going to /tmp/olivet/ -&gt; will move this to nextcloud, ideally by the app via appimage so that the db updates and I don't have to run that occ script
I wnat to organize &quot;home&quot; still in nextcloud</p>
<p>setup Sanoid</p>
<p>clean up bitwarden
learn nextcloud sharing -&gt; maybe just give a link to grandma?
rest of todos -&gt; document db and sanoid + zfs.rent</p>
<p>Check on mom's will
do media thing for church - split vocals on mp3/4</p>
<p>permission-data playbook changes everything to ansible-nas:ansible-nas but then samba task will re-permission some stuff to root:users... this looks fine
I had to add <code>group</code> to the samba config in my playbook to get user auth to work with samba
This isn't fully working... it works from cli but my python process can't write to a folder in dump after 777.... need to learn more?
So I can make a file after adding the ansible-nas group to config, but I still cannot make a directory on the smb mount...</p>
<p>ADDING <code>inherit permission = yes</code> under <code>[global]</code> in the smb.conf worked!</p>
<p>still not working from printer...
I think what I want is to setup 2 scan options - single docs right to paperless, or combined scans to dump, then manually split and send to paperless</p>
