<p>Paul's words are convicting this morning... <strong>I even consider all things to be loss</strong>.</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p>Do I?</p>
</div>
<p>Do I consider anything and everything as closer to <strong>literally nothing</strong> when
compared to knowing Jesus? I don't know, this morning I can't even articulate
what it means to consider allthings &quot;loss&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/pypeaday/images.pype.dev/main/blog-media/20251014103915_3412470b.png" alt="20251014103915_3412470b.png" /></p>
<p>What a trivial picture but how often is my mind and spirit stuck between the
green boxes... fixated again on my retirement, kid's school costs, the fact
that ribeye steak is still $20/lbs. I have anxities like anyone else over
things in the world, and if my net worth increased by $3M today what would my
response be... would I consider it a loss when compared to the knowledge of
Jesus Christ? Or would I experience joy and hope for my earthly future...</p>
<p>Of course Paul's note here isn't that we have to just be angry about good
things and be sad forever until we're on the other side of a consecrated
heaven, but I think the point is if my net worth goes up by a lot of down by a
lot, at the end of the day that's still between the 2 green boxes in my
diagram... And my mind needs to focus on Jesus. Not for what he can do for me,
pursuing him in light of my own fancies makes him out to be a Santa Claus, and
in light of Paul's words to the Philippian church would miss the point
entirely. There is nothing for us to pursue for gain - that is the point.</p>
<p>The ultimate gift is the knowledge of Christ. This knowledge changs us - by the
molding hand of Yahweh through the mediating power and authority of Jesus by
the Spirit indwelling our lives - the knowledge of Christ conforms us into his
image and likeness. But Jesus is the prize, he is the gain. Knowledge of him
isn't just knowing his name, it's being known by him through communion and
meditation. Through daily repentence.</p>

<p>I just found myself downcast over this reflection, knowledge of Christ is
hard... he chooses whome he chooses, frees whom he frees. In that freedom is
where the comparison can be made. Only in the freedom of Jesus can you remove
yourself from the line between the 2 green boxes in my picture, and even
consider the glory of the knowledge of Christ. Before new life all we know is
this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/pypeaday/images.pype.dev/main/blog-media/20251014105124_bee8ebbd.png" alt="20251014105124_bee8ebbd.png" /></p>
<p>He chooses... but then what? For some, loss must follow. In fact, for <strong>all</strong> loss
will eventually follow. The degree of that loss is not outside his sovereignty.
Paul says he &quot;suffered the loss of all things&quot; - in this experience his
mind is opened to the reality that was hidden from him, the knowledge that
there's more but the only thing worth gaining is Jesus.</p>
<p>I hope I don't have to suffer the loss of all things in order to more fully
grasp the gravity of my King. But his will be done on earth as it is in heaven,
whatever that may mean for my life. And may it be that I gain Christ.</p>
