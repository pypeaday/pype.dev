content: "# IDK WHEN\n\n- walkie-talkies!\n\n# 2025 (Gurnee)\n\nWe returned to Gurnee
  in June of 2025 (so a summer trip) and had a great time.\n\nWe experienced the bigger
  slides on this grip - and they were a blast. We had\nour oldest sneakly get up on
  her toes when the door guard measured her height\nand we got her JUST up to 48\"
  for the GREEN bracelet which got us on the double\nwhirlwind amongst other super
  fun slides.\n\nThis trip I also got the idea for the [[gwl-margarita-tracker]]!\n\n???+
  danger \"Magiquest Scam\"\n\n    If you buy the wand or a topper it seems like that
  includes a \"session\" of\n    the game. We brought our wands and toppers this time,
  and when we went to play\n    the game said our time expired... Turns out you have
  to pay $15 for another\n    session of playing even if you already bought all the
  gear!\n\n## Tips for packing\n\n- I brought my lulu shirts but the wristband snags
  them and my sweatshirts like\n  crazy - bring athletic hoodies and regular cotton
  t-shirts to avoid the snag\n- There is a Culver's literally down the street, you
  could walk... so if you'\n  re starving at night and don't want to spend $29 on
  a personal pizza, you can\n  take a quick hike for a butter burger\n\n## Food\n\nWe
  decided to try to save some money on food on this trip, but we had to be\ncareful...
  there's no condos so we were in a regular resort room. We brought\npulled pork and
  a crock pot which worked great. You get a mini fridge, so lunch\nmeats and cheeses
  made for easy sandwiches. There's an ice machine in the\nhallway if you want to
  keep anything on ice... We also brough a griddle,\nthinking we could cook up some
  eggs or something - and it might've worked but\nthe griddle was BRAND NEW so we
  got some smoke and didn't want to risk\nanything... we will certainly break it in
  and try it on the next trip so stay\ntuned...\n\n# 2025 (Dells)\n\nAfter experiencing
  the Gurnee location we were excited to checkout the Dells as well.\n\nThe waterpark
  is organized a little differently - and the only real\nobservations are that the
  wave pool is a lot bigger than Gurnee's but the lazy\nriver is a lot smaller...\n\nWe
  stayed in a condo during this trip, which was great with a kitchenette -\nbuying
  groceries and just doing sandwiches or pasta for meals saved a boat load\nof money,
  probably enough to nearly off-set the cost of the condo over a\nregular room.\n\nAt
  this location the Magiquest setup is unique - it's in its own building,\nwhich is
  setup as like a 4 story high jungle gym. It's very cool, and the kids\ncan run around
  to play the magiquest game, or ditch the wands and just run\naround and slide down
  slides and stuff... our kids had a blast at 3 and 5 years\nold.\n\n# 2023 (Gurnee)\n\nWe
  went to GWL in Gurnee in 2023 for the first time, and we didn't know exactly\nwhat
  to expect. We are also are not very experienced travelers, so packing for\na trip
  (particularly in the food department) is tough... which isn't a huge\ndeal - it
  just means we spent a LOT on food at the resort...\n\nFor this trip our kids were
  2 and 4 and it was still a valuable trip. The\nwaterpark is organized in such a
  way that the littler kids have their own space\naway from the bigger ones, it's
  very safe, and the slides and stuff even for\nthe littles are great.\n\nI'm writing
  this in July after our 3rd trip, so I don't have all the memories\nfrom this first
  one, but here's a short list of things if traveling with kids\nsay younger than
  5:\n\n1. water shoes would be a good purchase for the kids if they're going to be
  in the littles area. The ground there for some reason is murder on the feet (on
  a future visit we realzied the rest of the waterpark's ground isn't so bad... not
  sure why the kiddo's pool was so rough)\n2. you don't need to bring towels\n3. you
  don't need nearly as many clothes as you think, just underwear and enough swimming
  gear... no one is dressed in much more than swimwear and a cover-up like a t-shirt
  even at the restaurants pretty much"

    save some money on food on this trip, but we had to be\ncareful... there's no
    condos so we were in a regular resort room. We brought\npulled pork and a crock
    pot which worked great. You get a mini fridge, so lunch\nmeats and cheeses made
    for easy sandwiches. There's an ice machine in the\nhallway if you want to keep
    anything on ice... We also brough a griddle,\nthinking we could cook up some eggs
    or something - and it might've worked but\nthe griddle was BRAND NEW so we got
    some smoke and didn't want to risk\nanything... we will certainly break it in
    and try it on the next trip so stay\ntuned...</p>\n<h1 id=\"2025-dells\">2025

    Gurnee location we were excited to checkout the Dells as well.</p>\n<p>The waterpark
    is organized a little differently - and the only real\nobservations are that the
    wave pool is a lot bigger than Gurnee's but the lazy\nriver is a lot smaller...</p>\n<p>We
    stayed in a condo during this trip, which was great with a kitchenette -\nbuying
    groceries and just doing sandwiches or pasta for meals saved a boat load\nof money,
    probably enough to nearly off-set the cost of the condo over a\nregular room.</p>\n<p>At
    this location the Magiquest setup is unique - it's in its own building,\nwhich
    is setup as like a 4 story high jungle gym. It's very cool, and the kids\ncan
    run around to play the magiquest game, or ditch the wands and just run\naround
    and slide down slides and stuff... our kids had a blast at 3 and 5 years\nold.</p>\n<h1

    in 2023 for the first time, and we didn't know exactly\nwhat to expect. We are
    also are not very experienced travelers, so packing for\na trip (particularly
    in the food department) is tough... which isn't a huge\ndeal - it just means we
    spent a LOT on food at the resort...</p>\n<p>For this trip our kids were 2 and
    4 and it was still a valuable trip. The\nwaterpark is organized in such a way
    that the littler kids have their own space\naway from the bigger ones, it's very
    safe, and the slides and stuff even for\nthe littles are great.</p>\n<p>I'm writing
    this in July after our 3rd trip, so I don't have all the memories\nfrom this first
    one, but here's a short list of things if traveling with kids\nsay younger than
    5:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>water shoes would be a good purchase for the kids if they're
    going to be in the littles area. The ground there for some reason is murder on
    the feet (on a future visit we realzied the rest of the waterpark's ground isn't
    so bad... not sure why the kiddo's pool was so rough)</li>\n<li>you don't need
    to bring towels</li>\n<li>you don't need nearly as many clothes as you think,
    just underwear and enough swimming gear... no one is dressed in much more than
    swimwear and a cover-up like a t-shirt even at the restaurants pretty much</li>\n</ol>\n\n

    save some money on food on this trip, but we had to be\ncareful... there's no
    condos so we were in a regular resort room. We brought\npulled pork and a crock
    pot which worked great. You get a mini fridge, so lunch\nmeats and cheeses made
    for easy sandwiches. There's an ice machine in the\nhallway if you want to keep
    anything on ice... We also brough a griddle,\nthinking we could cook up some eggs
    or something - and it might've worked but\nthe griddle was BRAND NEW so we got
    some smoke and didn't want to risk\nanything... we will certainly break it in

    is organized a little differently - and the only real\nobservations are that the
    wave pool is a lot bigger than Gurnee's but the lazy\nriver is a lot smaller...</p>\n<p>We
    stayed in a condo during this trip, which was great with a kitchenette -\nbuying
    groceries and just doing sandwiches or pasta for meals saved a boat load\nof money,
    probably enough to nearly off-set the cost of the condo over a\nregular room.</p>\n<p>At
    this location the Magiquest setup is unique - it's in its own building,\nwhich
    is setup as like a 4 story high jungle gym. It's very cool, and the kids\ncan
    run around to play the magiquest game, or ditch the wands and just run\naround
    and slide down slides and stuff... our kids had a blast at 3 and 5 years\nold.</p>\n<h1

    in 2023 for the first time, and we didn't know exactly\nwhat to expect. We are
    also are not very experienced travelers, so packing for\na trip (particularly
    in the food department) is tough... which isn't a huge\ndeal - it just means we
    spent a LOT on food at the resort...</p>\n<p>For this trip our kids were 2 and
    4 and it was still a valuable trip. The\nwaterpark is organized in such a way
    that the littler kids have their own space\naway from the bigger ones, it's very
    safe, and the slides and stuff even for\nthe littles are great.</p>\n<p>I'm writing
    this in July after our 3rd trip, so I don't have all the memories\nfrom this first
    one, but here's a short list of things if traveling with kids\nsay younger than
    5:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>water shoes would be a good purchase for the kids if they're
    going to be in the littles area. The ground there for some reason is murder on
    the feet (on a future visit we realzied the rest of the waterpark's ground isn't
    so bad... not sure why the kiddo's pool was so rough)</li>\n<li>you don't need
    to bring towels</li>\n<li>you don't need nearly as many clothes as you think,
    just underwear and enough swimming gear... no one is dressed in much more than
    swimwear and a cover-up like a t-shirt even at the restaurants pretty much</li>\n</ol>\n\n

# IDK WHEN

- walkie-talkies!

# 2025 (Gurnee)

We returned to Gurnee in June of 2025 (so a summer trip) and had a great time.

We experienced the bigger slides on this grip - and they were a blast. We had
our oldest sneakly get up on her toes when the door guard measured her height
and we got her JUST up to 48" for the GREEN bracelet which got us on the double
whirlwind amongst other super fun slides.

This trip I also got the idea for the [[gwl-margarita-tracker]]!

???+ danger "Magiquest Scam"

    If you buy the wand or a topper it seems like that includes a "session" of
    the game. We brought our wands and toppers this time, and when we went to play
    the game said our time expired... Turns out you have to pay $15 for another
    session of playing even if you already bought all the gear!

## Tips for packing

- I brought my lulu shirts but the wristband snags them and my sweatshirts like
  crazy - bring athletic hoodies and regular cotton t-shirts to avoid the snag
- There is a Culver's literally down the street, you could walk... so if you'
  re starving at night and don't want to spend $29 on a personal pizza, you can
  take a quick hike for a butter burger

## Food

We decided to try to save some money on food on this trip, but we had to be
careful... there's no condos so we were in a regular resort room. We brought
pulled pork and a crock pot which worked great. You get a mini fridge, so lunch
meats and cheeses made for easy sandwiches. There's an ice machine in the
hallway if you want to keep anything on ice... We also brough a griddle,
thinking we could cook up some eggs or something - and it might've worked but
the griddle was BRAND NEW so we got some smoke and didn't want to risk
anything... we will certainly break it in and try it on the next trip so stay
tuned...

# 2025 (Dells)

After experiencing the Gurnee location we were excited to checkout the Dells as well.

The waterpark is organized a little differently - and the only real
observations are that the wave pool is a lot bigger than Gurnee's but the lazy
river is a lot smaller...

We stayed in a condo during this trip, which was great with a kitchenette -
buying groceries and just doing sandwiches or pasta for meals saved a boat load
of money, probably enough to nearly off-set the cost of the condo over a
regular room.

At this location the Magiquest setup is unique - it's in its own building,
which is setup as like a 4 story high jungle gym. It's very cool, and the kids
can run around to play the magiquest game, or ditch the wands and just run
around and slide down slides and stuff... our kids had a blast at 3 and 5 years
old.

# 2023 (Gurnee)

We went to GWL in Gurnee in 2023 for the first time, and we didn't know exactly
what to expect. We are also are not very experienced travelers, so packing for
a trip (particularly in the food department) is tough... which isn't a huge
deal - it just means we spent a LOT on food at the resort...

For this trip our kids were 2 and 4 and it was still a valuable trip. The
waterpark is organized in such a way that the littler kids have their own space
away from the bigger ones, it's very safe, and the slides and stuff even for
the littles are great.

I'm writing this in July after our 3rd trip, so I don't have all the memories
from this first one, but here's a short list of things if traveling with kids
say younger than 5:

1. water shoes would be a good purchase for the kids if they're going to be in the littles area. The ground there for some reason is murder on the feet (on a future visit we realzied the rest of the waterpark's ground isn't so bad... not sure why the kiddo's pool was so rough)
2. you don't need to bring towels
3. you don't need nearly as many clothes as you think, just underwear and enough swimming gear... no one is dressed in much more than swimwear and a cover-up like a t-shirt even at the restaurants pretty much
