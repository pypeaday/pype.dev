I stumbled into tab groups today when rearranging my tabs in firefox while bouncing between a few different things this morning. I'm thankful this article is from April of this year... otherwise this was a super boomer moment for me... As a heavy tech user I don't think a lot about my internet browsing experience except from a privacy standpoint. So thinking about automation and comfort within the browser - treating it like a first-class citizen in my development workflow and toolkit, will hopefully help me stay just a little bit more organized
