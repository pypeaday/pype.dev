content: "I've been really buggin out about a project I'm working on and nearly\nforgetting
  to spend meaningful time during the day/mornings on reflection.\nThankfully a 60
  second Bible Project video offered me a short framework this\nmorning to think about
  the land God created...\n\nThe video is a minute long, you can find it [on the Bible
  Project website](https://bibleproject.com/videos/vocab-insight-erets-land/)\n\nWhen
  I think about Bible stuff, especially anything related to Old Testament or\nCreation
  (which is actually literally everything) I have a hard time stopping\nmy mind from
  jumping to being critical of my brothers and sisters in Christ who\nadopt naieve
  or mainstream ideas about my Ancient Faith and King.\n\nOne of the things my spiritual
  family largely misses is the cosmic nature of\nthe creation account.... In this
  case of [[erets]], which shows up on page 1 of\nthe Bible, the Western mind reads
  \"In the beginning God created the heavens and\nthe earth...\" and we go \"oh, the
  globe, the planet, God made the planet,\nobviously\"\n\nAnd the thing is... ya,
  he did... but that's not what the creation story gets\nat, and what it does get
  at is what I'm reflecting on...\n\nGod put me on the erets, out of the dust of the
  erets he formed me, and you...\nThis is more than God drawing planet earth on the
  canvas of our universe.\nYahweh brought order to chaos, he created the heavens (literally
  \"the skies\")\nand filled it and he also created the earth and filled it. There
  is a parallel\nnature to these realms - the physical earthly realm of erets and
  the spiritual\nheavenly realm of the skies. These words carry ancient meaning in
  the creation\ncontext, they are poetic and visual in nature, rather than explanatory
  and\nphysical.\n\nRecognizing that the realm I'm in, God ordered and put me in,
  should bring\nmeaning to everything I do. My King does say to pray \"\\[God's\\]
  will be done on\nearth as it is in heaven\". I am supposed to be one of the ones
  \"bringing heaven\nto earth\" - carrying on the ministry of Jesus in the ways he
  commanded. Paul\ncommands to \"do everything with gratitude\" [philippians 4:6](https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm)\nin
  my heart towards Jesus. Jesus said plainly \"those who love me obey me\" [](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/John%2014%3A21)\n\nBut
  if I misunderstand my place in the cosmos, as a representative of the one\nTrue
  God to the physical realm he created that exists in a planar intersection\nwith
  the heavenly realm, if I misunderstand this I will misrepresent my God...\nand I
  fear I have been. I've been consumed with things inside my life lately,\nand perhaps
  that's moderately ok... I don't think that the present trials of my\nlife are drawing
  me away from Jesus at all, but I'd be an idiot to not\nrecognize that there are
  moments in my day where I feel like nothing matters,\nwhere I walk around on God's
  erets somewhat aimlessly due to my own\nself-loathing and consumption. These are
  moments where my flesh and sin are\nstrong, and the trials is revealing it. The
  meditation on my purpose in God's\ncreation, as a member of the realm of the ordered
  erets, is calming me in this\nmoment.\n\nGod's purpose for anyone is this:\n\n!!!
  note \"1 Thess. 5:18\"\n\n    give thanks in everything; for this is God\u2019s
  will for you in Christ Jesus.\n\nAt any moment, anyone one of us could be taken
  off earth - whether by old age\nlike my Grandma, or by violent hatred like [Charlie
  Kirk](). God's will (one of\nthe wills anyways) for anyone is the same, as a member
  of ordered creation\ncalled by Jesus it's my duty to live this out... and by God's
  grace I know\nit's possible by his intervention - to give thanks in everything.\n\nThe
  honest truth is I'm not really sure what to do besides take a breath every\nminute,
  acknowledge and preach the truth that Jesus is the author and perfector\nof my life
  and faith, and to pray this truth calms my heart in the midst of the\nturmoil I've
  been feeling lately.\n\nYahweh orders creation, he put all of us on the erets, and
  the message of his\ngrace goes out to all people.... who will answer and bring God's
  will to the\nearth? Thankfully it's not my job to know. My job is simple - to give
  thanks and to\nlove the Lord my God with all of me."

    \       <p>I've been really buggin out about a project I'm working on and nearly\nforgetting
    to spend meaningful time during the day/mornings on reflection.\nThankfully a
    60 second Bible Project video offered me a short framework this\nmorning to think
    about the land God created...</p>\n<p>The video is a minute long, you can find
    it <a href=\"https://bibleproject.com/videos/vocab-insight-erets-land/\">on the
    Bible Project website</a></p>\n<p>When I think about Bible stuff, especially anything
    related to Old Testament or\nCreation (which is actually literally everything)
    I have a hard time stopping\nmy mind from jumping to being critical of my brothers
    and sisters in Christ who\nadopt naieve or mainstream ideas about my Ancient Faith
    and King.</p>\n<p>One of the things my spiritual family largely misses is the
    cosmic nature of\nthe creation account.... In this case of <a class=\"wikilink\"
    href=\"/erets\">erets</a>, which shows up on page 1 of\nthe Bible, the Western
    mind reads &quot;In the beginning God created the heavens and\nthe earth...&quot;
    and we go &quot;oh, the globe, the planet, God made the planet,\nobviously&quot;</p>\n<p>And
    the thing is... ya, he did... but that's not what the creation story gets\nat,
    and what it does get at is what I'm reflecting on...</p>\n<p>God put me on the
    erets, out of the dust of the erets he formed me, and you...\nThis is more than
    God drawing planet earth on the canvas of our universe.\nYahweh brought order
    to chaos, he created the heavens (literally &quot;the skies&quot;)\nand filled
    it and he also created the earth and filled it. There is a parallel\nnature to
    these realms - the physical earthly realm of erets and the spiritual\nheavenly
    realm of the skies. These words carry ancient meaning in the creation\ncontext,
    they are poetic and visual in nature, rather than explanatory and\nphysical.</p>\n<p>Recognizing
    that the realm I'm in, God ordered and put me in, should bring\nmeaning to everything
    I do. My King does say to pray &quot;[God's] will be done on\nearth as it is in
    heaven&quot;. I am supposed to be one of the ones &quot;bringing heaven\nto earth&quot;
    - carrying on the ministry of Jesus in the ways he commanded. Paul\ncommands to
    &quot;do everything with gratitude&quot; <a href=\"https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm\">philippians
    4:6</a>\nin my heart towards Jesus. Jesus said plainly &quot;those who love me
    obey me&quot; <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/John%2014%3A21\"></a></p>\n<p>But
    if I misunderstand my place in the cosmos, as a representative of the one\nTrue
    God to the physical realm he created that exists in a planar intersection\nwith
    the heavenly realm, if I misunderstand this I will misrepresent my God...\nand
    I fear I have been. I've been consumed with things inside my life lately,\nand
    perhaps that's moderately ok... I don't think that the present trials of my\nlife
    are drawing me away from Jesus at all, but I'd be an idiot to not\nrecognize that
    there are moments in my day where I feel like nothing matters,\nwhere I walk around
    on God's erets somewhat aimlessly due to my own\nself-loathing and consumption.
    These are moments where my flesh and sin are\nstrong, and the trials is revealing
    it. The meditation on my purpose in God's\ncreation, as a member of the realm
    of the ordered erets, is calming me in this\nmoment.</p>\n<p>God's purpose for
    anyone is this:</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">1
    Thess. 5:18</p>\n<p>give thanks in everything; for this is God\u2019s will for
    you in Christ Jesus.</p>\n</div>\n<p>At any moment, anyone one of us could be
    taken off earth - whether by old age\nlike my Grandma, or by violent hatred like
    <a href=\"\">Charlie Kirk</a>. God's will (one of\nthe wills anyways) for anyone
    is the same, as a member of ordered creation\ncalled by Jesus it's my duty to
    live this out... and by God's grace I know\nit's possible by his intervention
    - to give thanks in everything.</p>\n<p>The honest truth is I'm not really sure
    what to do besides take a breath every\nminute, acknowledge and preach the truth
    that Jesus is the author and perfector\nof my life and faith, and to pray this
    truth calms my heart in the midst of the\nturmoil I've been feeling lately.</p>\n<p>Yahweh
    orders creation, he put all of us on the erets, and the message of his\ngrace
    goes out to all people.... who will answer and bring God's will to the\nearth?
    Thankfully it's not my job to know. My job is simple - to give thanks and to\nlove
    the Lord my God with all of me.</p>\n\n    </section>\n</article>        </div>\n

    \       <p>I've been really buggin out about a project I'm working on and nearly\nforgetting
    to spend meaningful time during the day/mornings on reflection.\nThankfully a
    60 second Bible Project video offered me a short framework this\nmorning to think
    about the land God created...</p>\n<p>The video is a minute long, you can find
    it <a href=\"https://bibleproject.com/videos/vocab-insight-erets-land/\">on the
    Bible Project website</a></p>\n<p>When I think about Bible stuff, especially anything
    related to Old Testament or\nCreation (which is actually literally everything)
    I have a hard time stopping\nmy mind from jumping to being critical of my brothers
    and sisters in Christ who\nadopt naieve or mainstream ideas about my Ancient Faith
    and King.</p>\n<p>One of the things my spiritual family largely misses is the
    cosmic nature of\nthe creation account.... In this case of <a class=\"wikilink\"
    href=\"/erets\">erets</a>, which shows up on page 1 of\nthe Bible, the Western
    mind reads &quot;In the beginning God created the heavens and\nthe earth...&quot;
    and we go &quot;oh, the globe, the planet, God made the planet,\nobviously&quot;</p>\n<p>And
    the thing is... ya, he did... but that's not what the creation story gets\nat,
    and what it does get at is what I'm reflecting on...</p>\n<p>God put me on the
    erets, out of the dust of the erets he formed me, and you...\nThis is more than
    God drawing planet earth on the canvas of our universe.\nYahweh brought order
    to chaos, he created the heavens (literally &quot;the skies&quot;)\nand filled
    it and he also created the earth and filled it. There is a parallel\nnature to
    these realms - the physical earthly realm of erets and the spiritual\nheavenly
    realm of the skies. These words carry ancient meaning in the creation\ncontext,
    they are poetic and visual in nature, rather than explanatory and\nphysical.</p>\n<p>Recognizing
    that the realm I'm in, God ordered and put me in, should bring\nmeaning to everything
    I do. My King does say to pray &quot;[God's] will be done on\nearth as it is in
    heaven&quot;. I am supposed to be one of the ones &quot;bringing heaven\nto earth&quot;
    - carrying on the ministry of Jesus in the ways he commanded. Paul\ncommands to
    &quot;do everything with gratitude&quot; <a href=\"https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm\">philippians
    4:6</a>\nin my heart towards Jesus. Jesus said plainly &quot;those who love me
    obey me&quot; <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/John%2014%3A21\"></a></p>\n<p>But
    if I misunderstand my place in the cosmos, as a representative of the one\nTrue
    God to the physical realm he created that exists in a planar intersection\nwith
    the heavenly realm, if I misunderstand this I will misrepresent my God...\nand
    I fear I have been. I've been consumed with things inside my life lately,\nand
    perhaps that's moderately ok... I don't think that the present trials of my\nlife
    are drawing me away from Jesus at all, but I'd be an idiot to not\nrecognize that
    there are moments in my day where I feel like nothing matters,\nwhere I walk around
    on God's erets somewhat aimlessly due to my own\nself-loathing and consumption.
    These are moments where my flesh and sin are\nstrong, and the trials is revealing
    it. The meditation on my purpose in God's\ncreation, as a member of the realm
    of the ordered erets, is calming me in this\nmoment.</p>\n<p>God's purpose for
    anyone is this:</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">1
    Thess. 5:18</p>\n<p>give thanks in everything; for this is God\u2019s will for
    you in Christ Jesus.</p>\n</div>\n<p>At any moment, anyone one of us could be
    taken off earth - whether by old age\nlike my Grandma, or by violent hatred like
    <a href=\"\">Charlie Kirk</a>. God's will (one of\nthe wills anyways) for anyone
    is the same, as a member of ordered creation\ncalled by Jesus it's my duty to
    live this out... and by God's grace I know\nit's possible by his intervention
    - to give thanks in everything.</p>\n<p>The honest truth is I'm not really sure
    what to do besides take a breath every\nminute, acknowledge and preach the truth
    that Jesus is the author and perfector\nof my life and faith, and to pray this
    truth calms my heart in the midst of the\nturmoil I've been feeling lately.</p>\n<p>Yahweh
    orders creation, he put all of us on the erets, and the message of his\ngrace
    goes out to all people.... who will answer and bring God's will to the\nearth?
    Thankfully it's not my job to know. My job is simple - to give thanks and to\nlove
    the Lord my God with all of me.</p>\n\n    </section>\n</article>"

title: Reflection (Short) - Erets


---

I've been really buggin out about a project I'm working on and nearly
forgetting to spend meaningful time during the day/mornings on reflection.
Thankfully a 60 second Bible Project video offered me a short framework this
morning to think about the land God created...

The video is a minute long, you can find it [on the Bible Project website](https://bibleproject.com/videos/vocab-insight-erets-land/)

When I think about Bible stuff, especially anything related to Old Testament or
Creation (which is actually literally everything) I have a hard time stopping
my mind from jumping to being critical of my brothers and sisters in Christ who
adopt naieve or mainstream ideas about my Ancient Faith and King.

One of the things my spiritual family largely misses is the cosmic nature of
the creation account.... In this case of [[erets]], which shows up on page 1 of
the Bible, the Western mind reads "In the beginning God created the heavens and
the earth..." and we go "oh, the globe, the planet, God made the planet,
obviously"

And the thing is... ya, he did... but that's not what the creation story gets
at, and what it does get at is what I'm reflecting on...

God put me on the erets, out of the dust of the erets he formed me, and you...
This is more than God drawing planet earth on the canvas of our universe.
Yahweh brought order to chaos, he created the heavens (literally "the skies")
and filled it and he also created the earth and filled it. There is a parallel
nature to these realms - the physical earthly realm of erets and the spiritual
heavenly realm of the skies. These words carry ancient meaning in the creation
context, they are poetic and visual in nature, rather than explanatory and
physical.

Recognizing that the realm I'm in, God ordered and put me in, should bring
meaning to everything I do. My King does say to pray "\[God's\] will be done on
earth as it is in heaven". I am supposed to be one of the ones "bringing heaven
to earth" - carrying on the ministry of Jesus in the ways he commanded. Paul
commands to "do everything with gratitude" [philippians 4:6](https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm)
in my heart towards Jesus. Jesus said plainly "those who love me obey me" [](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/John%2014%3A21)

But if I misunderstand my place in the cosmos, as a representative of the one
True God to the physical realm he created that exists in a planar intersection
with the heavenly realm, if I misunderstand this I will misrepresent my God...
and I fear I have been. I've been consumed with things inside my life lately,
and perhaps that's moderately ok... I don't think that the present trials of my
life are drawing me away from Jesus at all, but I'd be an idiot to not
recognize that there are moments in my day where I feel like nothing matters,
where I walk around on God's erets somewhat aimlessly due to my own
self-loathing and consumption. These are moments where my flesh and sin are
strong, and the trials is revealing it. The meditation on my purpose in God's
creation, as a member of the realm of the ordered erets, is calming me in this
moment.

God's purpose for anyone is this:

!!! note "1 Thess. 5:18"

    give thanks in everything; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus.

At any moment, anyone one of us could be taken off earth - whether by old age
like my Grandma, or by violent hatred like [Charlie Kirk](). God's will (one of
the wills anyways) for anyone is the same, as a member of ordered creation
called by Jesus it's my duty to live this out... and by God's grace I know
it's possible by his intervention - to give thanks in everything.

The honest truth is I'm not really sure what to do besides take a breath every
minute, acknowledge and preach the truth that Jesus is the author and perfector
of my life and faith, and to pray this truth calms my heart in the midst of the
turmoil I've been feeling lately.

Yahweh orders creation, he put all of us on the erets, and the message of his
grace goes out to all people.... who will answer and bring God's will to the
earth? Thankfully it's not my job to know. My job is simple - to give thanks and to
love the Lord my God with all of me.
