<p class="admonition-title">John 15:10-11</p>
<p>10 If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commandments and remain in his love. 11 I have spoken these things to you in order that my joy may be in you, and your joy may be made complete.</p>
</div>
<p>This is a beautiful couple verses about love that have only made more and more
sense to me as I get older and I have become a dad.</p>
<p>Commandments are not necessarily about <em>control</em>. I see this illogical line of thinking
EVERYWHERE - that advocating for rules and boundaries in life can quickly get
conflated with &quot;you want to control me/them!&quot;. I think the general population really
fails to understand that the lack of boundaries doesn't make you free, it turns
you into a slave of your most powerful desire. It is literally in the human-nature.</p>
<p>Random boundaries though are not helpful or loving... Restriction without
purpose, or for <em>the wrong</em> reason, can put you into a situation you weren't
designed to be in. I believe humans were created according to a design, and
like anything else with a purpose there are appropriate ways and places to
live, be, act, etc. as well as inappropriate ways and places. The
appropriatedness can only be determined by the one who knows the design
though.... otherwise someone is just guessing what the purposeful boundary or
restriction is.</p>
<p>In the case of our own reality, the architect of the universe is Jesus himself,
and in his divine knowledge of all of Creation he gives commandments
(boundaries and regulations) that are in <strong>perfect alignment with our design
and purpose</strong></p>
<p>From here it sounds so simple... The commandments from the Lord come from an
understanding of what is <strong>actually best for the human life</strong>. Because Jesus
<strong>actually knows better than you or me</strong> when we are in line with his
commandments, when we &quot;remain in [his] love&quot;, we are more in-line with our
created purpose than when we think we know better for ourselves. It's
practically a law of nature that things work best when used for their created
purpose, and in the human-design I think it's no different. Jesus offers the
framework for the fulfilled human life - it's not attainable without the
freedom to love him, but for the chosen - his joy follows love and freedom.</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">For who?</p>
<p>The life of freedom is only fully possible for whoever Jesus picks. Without
him awakening your heart to love what is truely lovely and hate what is truely
despicable then you'll never want anything that he offers. The
understanding of &quot;his way is better&quot; is only possible in the mind and heart of
the person whom Jesus raises to life out of the chaotic ocean of death.</p>
</div>
<p>Today God gives me the freedom to keep his commandments. I'll make my choice
moment by moment and pray continuously that he sustains my trust in him - to
ignore my dead-self's desires and instead to keep the commandments of the Lord
so that my joy may be made complete</p>
