## Writing

- published [[speakr-for-recording-and-transcribing-at-home]]

## Reflection

- These daily reflections are good, I'd like to organize them and perhaps all my
  posts a little bit as my blog usage has shifted in recent months and I expect
  it will in the coming months too. My current folder structure is more similar to tags and the folder is like the "primary" tag... I want to put some thought into this because some posts might need their own templates...

  - for example, "thoughts" has an admonition built in and I think my reflections could use a similar admonition

- [[reflection-john-4-14]]
