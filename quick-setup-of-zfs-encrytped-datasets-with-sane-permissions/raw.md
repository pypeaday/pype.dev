Assuming you have a pool called `tank`...

And assuming you have an encrypted dataset (See [Jim Saltar's short
intro](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/a-quick-start-guide-to-openzfs-native-encryption/))

1. Create a group for permissions - in my case I have one called `home`
2. Then if there's anything in `/tank/encrypted` his it with `chgrp -R home
   /tank/encrypted` to give the `home` group ownership
3. Next we need to make sure that the members of `home` can do the writing...
   so `chmod 775 -R /tank/encrypted` will do the trick
4. Finally we want to make sure that all data created inside our dataset has
   the same set of permissions with `chmod g+s /tank/encrypted` and `chmod g+w
   /tank/encrypted`
