## Reflection

- I wanted to read psalm 1 some this morning but am feeling like I should continue [[reflecting-on-romans-7-7-13]] perhaps for a few days...

???+ note "Psalm 1:2 (LEB)"

    2Â Instead, in the law of Yahweh is his delight,  and on his law he meditates day and night.  

- It's this meditation that I struggle to maintain for multiple days... In Hebrew its a word that can describe the sound a bear makes while it's chewing its food - a regular, consistent groaning over the food in their mouth... similarly we should be chewing on God's word, mulling it around in our heads and in this wisdom I feel the conviction to stay in Romans 7:7-13 for a little while
