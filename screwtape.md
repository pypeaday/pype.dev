content: "# Chapters\n\nBelow are just quick notes or quotes from each chapter as
  a reminder of what to\ngo back to chat about. This isn't intended to be in-depth
  by any stretch.\n\n## Chapter 1\n\n\"Your man has been accustomed, ever since he
  was a boy, to have a dozen\nincompatible philosophies dancing about together inside
  his head. He doesn't\nthink of doctrines as primarily 'true' or 'false', but as
  'academic' or\n'practical', 'outworn' or 'contemporary', 'conventional' or 'ruthless'\"\n\n##
  Chapter 2\n\n## Chapter 3\n\npg 11. Keeping the patient's mind focused on the 'inner
  life' so his actions do\nnot ever reflect his conversion\n\npg 12. Creating an imaginary
  person for whom to pray... \"In time, you may get\nthe cleavage so wide that no
  thought or feeling from his prayers for the\nimagined mother will ever flow over
  into his treatment of the real one\"\n\npg 13-14. \"Let him assume that she knows
  how annoying it is and does it to\nannoy - if you know your job he will not notice
  the immense improbability of\nthe assumption\" -> This point is particularly convicting
  to me\n\n!!! background-thought \"\"\n\n    The last point about encouraging the
  patient to interpret the mother's every\n    move in an over-sensitive fashion is
  actually very relatable for me\n\n## Chapter 4\n\npg 15. Convincing the patient
  that scheduled prayer is wrong and that he must\ncreate a _mood_ within himself
  for real prayer reminds me of high school youth\ngroups talking about \"praying
  in the spirit\" and silly conversation \"combating\nsalvation by works\" ideas like
  scheduled prayer times.\n\npg 16. \"they constantly forget, what you must always
  remember, that they are\nanimals and that whatever their bodies do affects their
  souls\" \U0001F448 feels a lot\nlike Genesis 3, and humans are never more human
  than when we exercise\nself-control.\n\npg. 16. \"Keep them watching their own minds
  and trying to produce _feelings_\nthere by the action of their own wills\"\n\n!!!
  background-thought \"\"\n\n    I totally remember feeling like I needed to want
  to pray in order for my\n    prayers to matter\n\npg 17. \"When they say they re
  praying for forgiveness, let them be trying to\nfeel forgiven\"\n\npg 18. \"But
  whatever the nature of the composite object, you must keep him\npraying to _it_
  - to the thing that he has made, not to the Person who has made\nhim\"\n\n!!! background-thought
  \"\"\n\n    Lewis talking actual idolatry with meaningful consequences... not the
  \"money\n    is my idol\" take most pastors preach\n\n## Chapter 5\n\npg 23. \"...while
  tens of thousands who do not go so far as that will\nnevertheless have their attention
  diverted from themselves to values and causes\nwhich they believe to be higher than
  the self. I know that the Enemy\ndisapproves many of these causes. But that is where
  He is so unfair. He often\nmakes prizes of humans who have given their lives for
  causes He think bad on\nthe monstrously sophistical ground that the humans thought
  them good and were\nfollowing the best they knew\"\n\n!!! warning \"WARNING TITLE\"\n\n
  \   This reminds me of the young Tarkan in Narnia: The Last Battle, who Aslan\n
  \   ascribes all his good deeds done to Tash as done to himself - effectively\n
  \   saying the Tarkan's loyalty to the wrong god is honored by Aslan? Definitely\n
  \   want to know more about Lewis' thoughts there and here in Screwtape\n\n## Chapter
  6\n\npg 25. \"There is nothing like suspense and anxiety for barricading a human's\nmind
  against the Enemy.\"\n\n!!! warning \"\"\n\n    Screwtape's point in the beinning
  of the chapter confuses me... He instructs\n    Wormwood to keep the man thinking
  that the things he is anxious about, the\n    things themselves, are his trials/cross
  to bear, rather than the anxiety\n    itself. So from the Christian perspective,
  Lewis seems to be saying that the\n    real-time, present, acute anxiety and suspense
  in the man's heart regarding the\n    war is the actual trial and cross... not the
  things the man is anxious about. I\n    don't know what to do with this but it _feels_
  convicting to me. Growing up I\n    often had the thought that nothing could be
  wrong because \"I have Jesus\", and I\n    would look at my circumstances as things
  to bear - for me the biggest one was\n    singleness. So would Lewis say my outlook
  on my singleness as the thing to\n    bear, rather than the anxiety about being
  single, was the enemy twisting my\n    convictions to be inward rather than God-ward?
  It clearly looks like my\n    convictions were inward, but I'm not sure I understand
  how seeing the anxiety\n    itself as my \"cross to bare\" is any more Biblical...\n\n##
  Chapter 7\n\npage 32. \"The fact that 'devils' are predominately _comic_ figures
  in the\nmodern imagination will help you\"\n\n!!! background-thought \"\"\n\n    I
  think It's funny because I bet most people, myself included, reading this book (at\n
  \   least the first time) have a red-devil type figure in mind for Screwtape or\n
  \   Wormwood\n\npage 31-32. \"If once we can produce our perfect work -- the Materialist\nMagician,
  the man, not using, but veritably worshipping, what he vaguely called\n'Froces'
  while denying the existence of 'spirits' -- then the end of the war\nwill be in
  sight.\"\n\n!!! background-thought \"\"\n\n  I hear some non-Christian friends say
  things like \"I'm spiritual so I\n  appreciate your prayers\". In a sense they believe
  in some kind of\n  non-physical \"thing\" but not in any real sense so it looks,
  to me, similar to\n  what Screwtape longs for in his letter to Wormwood.\n\npage
  32. \"All extremes, except extreme deviotion to the Enemy, are to be\nencouraged...
  Other ages, of which the present is one, are unbalanced and prone\nto faction, and
  it is our business to inflame them\"\n\n!!! background-thought \"\"\n\n    Using
  Christianity to justify political positions or judgement seems right\n    here.
  Extreme devotion to our God I don't think should offend people as often\n    or
  to the degree that many Christians think is right... People flocked to\n    Jesus,
  only the religious elite and politically powerful hated him. When\n    Christianity
  is mixed with anything other than itself, that's when it becomes\n    offensive.
  I think I see people hold to something like Christian Nationalism,\n    and the
  offensive nature of it justifies the position because \"we were always\n    going
  to be persecured for loving Jesus\"\n\n!!! danger \"page 34\"\n\n    Let him begin
  by treating the Patriotism or the Pacifism as a part of his\n    religion. Then
  let him, under then influence of partisan spirit, come to\n    regard it as the
  most important part...\n\n## Chapter 8\n\n!!! success \"page 39\"\n\n    For He
  cannot ravish. He can only woo.\n\n!!! note \"page 40\"\n\n    He wants them to
  learn to walk and must therefore take away His hand; and\n    if only the will to
  walk is really there He is pleased even with their\n    stumbles\n\n## Chapter 9\n\npage
  43. \"In the first place I have always found that the trough periods of the\nhuman
  undulation provide excellen opportunity for all sensual tempations,\nparticularly
  those of sex... The attack has a much better chance of success\nwhen the man's whole
  innter world is drab and cold and empty.\"\n\n!!! background-thought \"\"\n\n    I
  feel this observation in my own life deeply - in my 'troughs' I'm drawn to\n    pleasurable
  things in a very unpleasurable way\n\n!!! success \"page 44\"\n\n    Never forget
  that when we are dealing with any pleasure in its healthy and\n    normal and satisfying
  form, we are, in a sense, on the Enemy's ground.\n\n!!! danger \"jargon not wisdom\"\n\n
  \   Of course there is no conceivable way of getting by reason from the\n    proposition
  'I am losing interest in this' to the proposition 'This is\n    false'/ But, as
  I said before, it is jargon, not reason, you must rely on.\n\n## Chapter 10\n\npage
  49. \"Did he commit himself deeply? I don't mean the words. There is a\nsubtle play
  of looks and tons and laughs by which a mortal can imply that he is\nof the same
  party as those to whom he is speaking\"\n\n!!! background-thought \"\"\n\n    I
  resonate with the temptation Scretape is basically instructing Wormwood to\n    employ
  - two-facedness/double-life. In hs/college in particular I would 'play\n    the
  part' to fit in to a particular crowd. I'd rarely confess Christianity\n    early
  on, would never deny it explicitly, but would act and talk in a\n    way/about things
  to imply that I was not necessarily non-Christian, but\n    instead nothing to ask
  about.\n\n    Chapter 10 in overall convicting as it just drives home the point
  I noted\n    just now.... that I'm very prone to 'acting' in order to fit into a
  community\n\n## Chatper 11\n\npage 55. \"The real use of Joke or Humour is in quite
  a different direction, and\nit is specially promising among the English who take
  their 'sense of humour' so\nseriously that a deficiency in this sense is almost
  the only deficiency at\nwhich they feel shame. Humour is for them the all-consoling
  and (mark this) the\nall-excusing, grace of life\"\n\n!!! danger \"all-excusing
  grace of life\"\n\n    Humour is for them the all-consoling and (mark this) the
  all-excusing,\n    grace of life\n\n!!! background-thought \"\"\n\n    Basically
  I understand Lewis to be saying here that men (or the English in\n    particular)
  take great pride in having a sense of humor - so much so that\n    humor becomes
  an excuse to laugh at anything. When anything is worth laughing\n    at, then I
  think it's very hard to prioritize things above others - becuase\n    if everything
  is a joke, is anything really worthy of more than a joke?\n\n!!! warning \"Flippancy\"\n\n
  \   I didn't understand flippancy as first because I've always kind of equated\n
  \   it with \"quick\". However, it's more of a \"quickness\" paired with a total\n
  \   lack of respect/awareness for/of X.\n\n!!! warning \"churches\"\n\n    Are there
  areas in the church where we are flippant (specifically with humor I guess?)\n\n##
  Chapter 12\n\n!!! danger \"page 57-58\"\n\n    As long as he retains externally
  the habits of a Christian he can still be\n    made to think of himself as one who
  has adopted a few new friends and\n    amusements but whose spiritual state is much
  the same as it was six weeks\n    ago.\n\npage 58. [The dim uneasiness about `backsliding`
  Screwtape describes in the\nchapter] increases the patient's reluctance to think
  about the Enemy.\n\n!!! background-thought \"\"\n\n    This is too real for me -
  in seasons of rebellion, and honestly anytime I\n    fall away from \"Christian
  habits\" I notice that I am actually reluctant to\n    pray or meditate. Often the
  only thing that (or the initial thing in\n    appearance) that brings me back is
  my kids and praying with them or singing\n    Doxology. A choice I wouldnt' make
  alone, but make for their sake - perhaps\n    this is God's grace poured out on
  me\n\n!!! danger \"page 58\"\n\n    They hate every idea that suggests Him, just
  as men in financial\n    embarrassment hate the very sight of a pass-book.\n\n##
  Chapter 13\n\nParticularly a challenging chapter. It's interesting to think about
  pleasurable\nthings, for their own sake and not enjoyed outside the boundaires set
  for\npleasure by God, are harmful to our enemy's tactics. I do not know if I enjoy\nthings
  for their own sake enough or rightly....\n\n!!! warning \"\"\n\n    Do my tech hobbies
  make me more human or less by distracting me from holier\n    things...\n\n## Chapter
  14\n\n!!! warning \"page 69\"\n\n    All virtues are less formidable to us once
  the man is aware that he has\n    them, but this is specially true of humility.\n\n##
  Chapter 16\n\n!!! note \"page 81\"\n\n    In the first place the parochial organisation
  [Church] should always be\n    attacked, because, being a _unity of place and not
  of likings_, it brings\n    people of different classes and psychology together
  in the kind of unity\n    the Enemy desires\n\n!!! danger \"page 82-83\"\n\n    In
  order to spare the laity all 'difficulties' he has deserted both the\n    lectionary
  and the appointed psalms and now, without noticing it, revoles\n    endlessly round
  the little treadmill of his fifteen favourite psalms and\n    twenty favorite lessons.\n\n##
  Chapter 17\n\n!!! background-thought \"\"\n\n    Gluttony of Delicacy, not gluttony
  of Excess\n\n!!! danger \"page 88\"\n\n    You see? Because what she wants is smaller
  and less costly than what has\n    been set before her, she never recognises as
  gluttony her determination to\n    get what she wants, however troublesome it may
  be to others\n\n## Chapter 18\n\nScrewtape's lack of understanding,and arrogant
  questioning, of the Enemy's\n_love_ is a hilarious commentary on humans who stand
  staunchly opposed to\nYahweh. Academic peers of mine, with such amazing pride, speaking
  aginst the\nBiblical narrative because _it doesn't make sense_... Lewis makes a
  good point\nthrough Screwtape \"Members of His faction have frequently admitted
  that if ever\nwe [demons] came to understand what He means by love, the war would
  be over and\nwe should re-enter Heaven\". I think Lewis' point dovetails with the
  idea that\nJesus is actually very compelling and the rubbish about him being offensive
  is\na replay of the Gospels - where the rich and elite are the ones offended, not\nthe
  people he calls to the kingdom. Jesus' love doesn't make sense to those who\nhave
  everything they think they need... His love is for those who know they are\nlowly\n\n##

  background-thought \"\"\n\n    I think about Summit in particular, where I got to
  meet a lot of big names in\n    apologetics, and I'd talk about them to others like
  we were friends... The\n    difference between \"I know X\" and \"X knows me\" is
  a thing I kept hidden so I\n    could feel important\n\n## Chatper 25\n\n!!! danger
  \"Christianity And...\"\n\n    What we want, if men becomes Christians at all, is
  to koeep them in the\n    state of mind I call 'Christianity And'. You know - Christianity
  and the\n    Crisis,Christianity and the New Order, ...\n\n!!! background-thought
  \"\"\n\n    I don't know... smells more and more like Christian Nationalism is the\n
  \   modern-day `Christinaity And`... So much focus on policy, behavior, order\n
  \   (patriarchy even).... Not a lot about Jesus _in the conversation about\n    Christian
  Nationalism_ (not that Christians in this mindset don't genuinely\n    love Jesus
  or talk about him - but I don't hear Jesus often in the\n    conversation, I only
  hear the politics). But I suppose to be fair there's\n    every chance in the world
  that I misunderstand the position and people.\n\n!!! danger \"\"\n\n    But if I
  do misunderstand... A fairly educated, theologically competent,\n    Biblically
  literate person... then what do Christian Nationalists expect of\n    people who
  never heard of Jesus, or already were introduced to Republican\n    Jesus or something...
  I'm not the cream of the crop, but if I don't\n    properly understand what the
  position is about then the world, unbelievers\n    I mean, will be even more turned
  off to the Gospel\n\nPage 139 - \"We have trained them to think of the Future as
  a promised land\nwhich favoured heroes attain - not as something which everyone
  reaches at the\nrate of sixety minutes an hour, whatever he does, whoever he is...\"\n\n##
  Chatper 26\n\n!!! danger \"_Unselfishness_\"\n\n    Note, once again, the admirable
  work of our Philological Arm in\n    substituting the negative unselfishness for
  the Enemy's positive Charity\n\n> Big one for me... hard to even process\n\n!!!
  warning \"page 143\"\n\n    In discussing any joint action, it becomes obligatory
  thta A should argue\n    in favour of B's supposed wishes and against his own, while
  B does the\n    opposite\n\n!!! background-thought \"\"\n\n    Going out to eat,
  what to do tonight, etc... simple things, not big ones\n    (like how to discipline
  our kids), is where this is just rampant in my\n    life... I constantly and consciously
  say in my head \"X will make my wife\n    happier even though I don't want to\"
  then after whatever \"X\" is, turns out\n    she didn't really care or want it _OR_
  she's upset because she feels like a\n    nuisance to me... Then the reality is
  I don't actually know if I saw her as a\n    nuisance in that moment, or if I genuinely
  wanted to do what she wanted out\n    of love and charity...\n\n!!! warning \"page
  144\"\n\n    He insists on doing 'what the others want'. They insist on doing what
  he\n    wants. Passions are roused. Soon someone is saying 'Very well then, I won't\n
  \   have any tea at all!', and a real quarrel ensues with bitter resentment on\n
  \   both sides.\n\n> Happens all the freaking time, and at the end of it I'm left
  with \"wtf just happened?\"\n\n## Chatper 27\n\n> TODO: Go through and make notes\n\n##

    the beinning of the chapter confuses me... He instructs\nWormwood to keep the
    man thinking that the things he is anxious about, the\nthings themselves, are
    his trials/cross to bear, rather than the anxiety\nitself. So from the Christian
    perspective, Lewis seems to be saying that the\nreal-time, present, acute anxiety
    and suspense in the man's heart regarding the\nwar is the actual trial and cross...
    not the things the man is anxious about. I\ndon't know what to do with this but
    it <em>feels</em> convicting to me. Growing up I\noften had the thought that nothing
    could be wrong because &quot;I have Jesus&quot;, and I\nwould look at my circumstances
    as things to bear - for me the biggest one was\nsingleness. So would Lewis say
    my outlook on my singleness as the thing to\nbear, rather than the anxiety about
    being single, was the enemy twisting my\nconvictions to be inward rather than
    God-ward? It clearly looks like my\nconvictions were inward, but I'm not sure
    I understand how seeing the anxiety\nitself as my &quot;cross to bare&quot; is
    any more Biblical...</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-7\">Chapter 7 <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    commentary on humans who stand staunchly opposed to\nYahweh. Academic peers of
    mine, with such amazing pride, speaking aginst the\nBiblical narrative because
    <em>it doesn't make sense</em>... Lewis makes a good point\nthrough Screwtape
    &quot;Members of His faction have frequently admitted that if ever\nwe [demons]
    came to understand what He means by love, the war would be over and\nwe should
    re-enter Heaven&quot;. I think Lewis' point dovetails with the idea that\nJesus
    is actually very compelling and the rubbish about him being offensive is\na replay
    of the Gospels - where the rich and elite are the ones offended, not\nthe people
    he calls to the kingdom. Jesus' love doesn't make sense to those who\nhave everything
    they think they need... His love is for those who know they are\nlowly</p>\n<h2

    nothing like suspense and anxiety for barricading a human's\nmind against the
    Enemy.&quot;</p>\n<div class=\"admonition warning\">\n<p>Screwtape's point in
    the beinning of the chapter confuses me... He instructs\nWormwood to keep the
    man thinking that the things he is anxious about, the\nthings themselves, are
    his trials/cross to bear, rather than the anxiety\nitself. So from the Christian
    perspective, Lewis seems to be saying that the\nreal-time, present, acute anxiety
    and suspense in the man's heart regarding the\nwar is the actual trial and cross...
    not the things the man is anxious about. I\ndon't know what to do with this but
    it <em>feels</em> convicting to me. Growing up I\noften had the thought that nothing
    could be wrong because &quot;I have Jesus&quot;, and I\nwould look at my circumstances
    as things to bear - for me the biggest one was\nsingleness. So would Lewis say
    my outlook on my singleness as the thing to\nbear, rather than the anxiety about
    being single, was the enemy twisting my\nconvictions to be inward rather than
    God-ward? It clearly looks like my\nconvictions were inward, but I'm not sure
    I understand how seeing the anxiety\nitself as my &quot;cross to bare&quot; is
    any more Biblical...</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-7\">Chapter 7 <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    mine, with such amazing pride, speaking aginst the\nBiblical narrative because
    <em>it doesn't make sense</em>... Lewis makes a good point\nthrough Screwtape
    &quot;Members of His faction have frequently admitted that if ever\nwe [demons]
    came to understand what He means by love, the war would be over and\nwe should
    re-enter Heaven&quot;. I think Lewis' point dovetails with the idea that\nJesus
    is actually very compelling and the rubbish about him being offensive is\na replay
    of the Gospels - where the rich and elite are the ones offended, not\nthe people
    he calls to the kingdom. Jesus' love doesn't make sense to those who\nhave everything

    nothing like suspense and anxiety for barricading a human's\nmind against the
    Enemy.&quot;</p>\n<div class=\"admonition warning\">\n<p>Screwtape's point in
    the beinning of the chapter confuses me... He instructs\nWormwood to keep the
    man thinking that the things he is anxious about, the\nthings themselves, are
    his trials/cross to bear, rather than the anxiety\nitself. So from the Christian
    perspective, Lewis seems to be saying that the\nreal-time, present, acute anxiety
    and suspense in the man's heart regarding the\nwar is the actual trial and cross...
    not the things the man is anxious about. I\ndon't know what to do with this but
    it <em>feels</em> convicting to me. Growing up I\noften had the thought that nothing
    could be wrong because &quot;I have Jesus&quot;, and I\nwould look at my circumstances
    as things to bear - for me the biggest one was\nsingleness. So would Lewis say
    my outlook on my singleness as the thing to\nbear, rather than the anxiety about
    being single, was the enemy twisting my\nconvictions to be inward rather than
    God-ward? It clearly looks like my\nconvictions were inward, but I'm not sure
    I understand how seeing the anxiety\nitself as my &quot;cross to bare&quot; is
    any more Biblical...</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"chapter-7\">Chapter 7 <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    understanding,and arrogant questioning, of the Enemy's\n<em>love</em> is a hilarious
    commentary on humans who stand staunchly opposed to\nYahweh. Academic peers of
    mine, with such amazing pride, speaking aginst the\nBiblical narrative because
    <em>it doesn't make sense</em>... Lewis makes a good point\nthrough Screwtape
    &quot;Members of His faction have frequently admitted that if ever\nwe [demons]
    came to understand what He means by love, the war would be over and\nwe should
    re-enter Heaven&quot;. I think Lewis' point dovetails with the idea that\nJesus
    is actually very compelling and the rubbish about him being offensive is\na replay
    of the Gospels - where the rich and elite are the ones offended, not\nthe people
    he calls to the kingdom. Jesus' love doesn't make sense to those who\nhave everything
    they think they need... His love is for those who know they are\nlowly</p>\n<h2

  raw.md: "---\ntemplateKey: blog-post\ntags: [\"books\", \"faith\"]\ntitle: Screwtape\ndate:
    2022-08-22T00:00:00\ncover: \"media/screwtape.png\"\npublished: true\n---\n\n#
    Chapters\n\nBelow are just quick notes or quotes from each chapter as a reminder
    of what to\ngo back to chat about. This isn't intended to be in-depth by any stretch.\n\n##
    Chapter 1\n\n\"Your man has been accustomed, ever since he was a boy, to have
    a dozen\nincompatible philosophies dancing about together inside his head. He
    doesn't\nthink of doctrines as primarily 'true' or 'false', but as 'academic'
    or\n'practical', 'outworn' or 'contemporary', 'conventional' or 'ruthless'\"\n\n##
    Chapter 2\n\n## Chapter 3\n\npg 11. Keeping the patient's mind focused on the
    'inner life' so his actions do\nnot ever reflect his conversion\n\npg 12. Creating
    an imaginary person for whom to pray... \"In time, you may get\nthe cleavage so
    wide that no thought or feeling from his prayers for the\nimagined mother will
    ever flow over into his treatment of the real one\"\n\npg 13-14. \"Let him assume
    that she knows how annoying it is and does it to\nannoy - if you know your job
    he will not notice the immense improbability of\nthe assumption\" -> This point
    is particularly convicting to me\n\n!!! background-thought \"\"\n\n    The last
    point about encouraging the patient to interpret the mother's every\n    move
    in an over-sensitive fashion is actually very relatable for me\n\n## Chapter 4\n\npg
    15. Convincing the patient that scheduled prayer is wrong and that he must\ncreate
    a _mood_ within himself for real prayer reminds me of high school youth\ngroups
    talking about \"praying in the spirit\" and silly conversation \"combating\nsalvation
    by works\" ideas like scheduled prayer times.\n\npg 16. \"they constantly forget,
    what you must always remember, that they are\nanimals and that whatever their
    bodies do affects their souls\" \U0001F448 feels a lot\nlike Genesis 3, and humans
    are never more human than when we exercise\nself-control.\n\npg. 16. \"Keep them
    watching their own minds and trying to produce _feelings_\nthere by the action
    of their own wills\"\n\n!!! background-thought \"\"\n\n    I totally remember
    feeling like I needed to want to pray in order for my\n    prayers to matter\n\npg
    17. \"When they say they re praying for forgiveness, let them be trying to\nfeel
    forgiven\"\n\npg 18. \"But whatever the nature of the composite object, you must
    keep him\npraying to _it_ - to the thing that he has made, not to the Person who
    has made\nhim\"\n\n!!! background-thought \"\"\n\n    Lewis talking actual idolatry
    with meaningful consequences... not the \"money\n    is my idol\" take most pastors
    preach\n\n## Chapter 5\n\npg 23. \"...while tens of thousands who do not go so
    far as that will\nnevertheless have their attention diverted from themselves to
    values and causes\nwhich they believe to be higher than the self. I know that
    the Enemy\ndisapproves many of these causes. But that is where He is so unfair.
    He often\nmakes prizes of humans who have given their lives for causes He think
    bad on\nthe monstrously sophistical ground that the humans thought them good and
    were\nfollowing the best they knew\"\n\n!!! warning \"WARNING TITLE\"\n\n    This
    reminds me of the young Tarkan in Narnia: The Last Battle, who Aslan\n    ascribes
    all his good deeds done to Tash as done to himself - effectively\n    saying the
    Tarkan's loyalty to the wrong god is honored by Aslan? Definitely\n    want to
    know more about Lewis' thoughts there and here in Screwtape\n\n## Chapter 6\n\npg
    25. \"There is nothing like suspense and anxiety for barricading a human's\nmind
    against the Enemy.\"\n\n!!! warning \"\"\n\n    Screwtape's point in the beinning
    of the chapter confuses me... He instructs\n    Wormwood to keep the man thinking
    that the things he is anxious about, the\n    things themselves, are his trials/cross
    to bear, rather than the anxiety\n    itself. So from the Christian perspective,
    Lewis seems to be saying that the\n    real-time, present, acute anxiety and suspense
    in the man's heart regarding the\n    war is the actual trial and cross... not
    the things the man is anxious about. I\n    don't know what to do with this but
    it _feels_ convicting to me. Growing up I\n    often had the thought that nothing
    could be wrong because \"I have Jesus\", and I\n    would look at my circumstances
    as things to bear - for me the biggest one was\n    singleness. So would Lewis
    say my outlook on my singleness as the thing to\n    bear, rather than the anxiety
    about being single, was the enemy twisting my\n    convictions to be inward rather
    than God-ward? It clearly looks like my\n    convictions were inward, but I'm
    not sure I understand how seeing the anxiety\n    itself as my \"cross to bare\"
    is any more Biblical...\n\n## Chapter 7\n\npage 32. \"The fact that 'devils' are
    predominately _comic_ figures in the\nmodern imagination will help you\"\n\n!!!
    background-thought \"\"\n\n    I think It's funny because I bet most people, myself
    included, reading this book (at\n    least the first time) have a red-devil type
    figure in mind for Screwtape or\n    Wormwood\n\npage 31-32. \"If once we can
    produce our perfect work -- the Materialist\nMagician, the man, not using, but
    veritably worshipping, what he vaguely called\n'Froces' while denying the existence
    of 'spirits' -- then the end of the war\nwill be in sight.\"\n\n!!! background-thought
    \"\"\n\n  I hear some non-Christian friends say things like \"I'm spiritual so
    I\n  appreciate your prayers\". In a sense they believe in some kind of\n  non-physical
    \"thing\" but not in any real sense so it looks, to me, similar to\n  what Screwtape
    longs for in his letter to Wormwood.\n\npage 32. \"All extremes, except extreme
    deviotion to the Enemy, are to be\nencouraged... Other ages, of which the present
    is one, are unbalanced and prone\nto faction, and it is our business to inflame
    them\"\n\n!!! background-thought \"\"\n\n    Using Christianity to justify political
    positions or judgement seems right\n    here. Extreme devotion to our God I don't
    think should offend people as often\n    or to the degree that many Christians
    think is right... People flocked to\n    Jesus, only the religious elite and politically
    powerful hated him. When\n    Christianity is mixed with anything other than itself,
    that's when it becomes\n    offensive. I think I see people hold to something
    like Christian Nationalism,\n    and the offensive nature of it justifies the
    position because \"we were always\n    going to be persecured for loving Jesus\"\n\n!!!
    danger \"page 34\"\n\n    Let him begin by treating the Patriotism or the Pacifism
    as a part of his\n    religion. Then let him, under then influence of partisan
    spirit, come to\n    regard it as the most important part...\n\n## Chapter 8\n\n!!!
    success \"page 39\"\n\n    For He cannot ravish. He can only woo.\n\n!!! note
    \"page 40\"\n\n    He wants them to learn to walk and must therefore take away
    His hand; and\n    if only the will to walk is really there He is pleased even
    with their\n    stumbles\n\n## Chapter 9\n\npage 43. \"In the first place I have
    always found that the trough periods of the\nhuman undulation provide excellen
    opportunity for all sensual tempations,\nparticularly those of sex... The attack
    has a much better chance of success\nwhen the man's whole innter world is drab
    and cold and empty.\"\n\n!!! background-thought \"\"\n\n    I feel this observation
    in my own life deeply - in my 'troughs' I'm drawn to\n    pleasurable things in
    a very unpleasurable way\n\n!!! success \"page 44\"\n\n    Never forget that when
    we are dealing with any pleasure in its healthy and\n    normal and satisfying
    form, we are, in a sense, on the Enemy's ground.\n\n!!! danger \"jargon not wisdom\"\n\n
    \   Of course there is no conceivable way of getting by reason from the\n    proposition
    'I am losing interest in this' to the proposition 'This is\n    false'/ But, as
    I said before, it is jargon, not reason, you must rely on.\n\n## Chapter 10\n\npage
    49. \"Did he commit himself deeply? I don't mean the words. There is a\nsubtle
    play of looks and tons and laughs by which a mortal can imply that he is\nof the
    same party as those to whom he is speaking\"\n\n!!! background-thought \"\"\n\n
    \   I resonate with the temptation Scretape is basically instructing Wormwood
    to\n    employ - two-facedness/double-life. In hs/college in particular I would
    'play\n    the part' to fit in to a particular crowd. I'd rarely confess Christianity\n
    \   early on, would never deny it explicitly, but would act and talk in a\n    way/about
    things to imply that I was not necessarily non-Christian, but\n    instead nothing
    to ask about.\n\n    Chapter 10 in overall convicting as it just drives home the
    point I noted\n    just now.... that I'm very prone to 'acting' in order to fit
    into a community\n\n## Chatper 11\n\npage 55. \"The real use of Joke or Humour
    is in quite a different direction, and\nit is specially promising among the English
    who take their 'sense of humour' so\nseriously that a deficiency in this sense
    is almost the only deficiency at\nwhich they feel shame. Humour is for them the
    all-consoling and (mark this) the\nall-excusing, grace of life\"\n\n!!! danger
    \"all-excusing grace of life\"\n\n    Humour is for them the all-consoling and
    (mark this) the all-excusing,\n    grace of life\n\n!!! background-thought \"\"\n\n
    \   Basically I understand Lewis to be saying here that men (or the English in\n
    \   particular) take great pride in having a sense of humor - so much so that\n
    \   humor becomes an excuse to laugh at anything. When anything is worth laughing\n
    \   at, then I think it's very hard to prioritize things above others - becuase\n
    \   if everything is a joke, is anything really worthy of more than a joke?\n\n!!!
    warning \"Flippancy\"\n\n    I didn't understand flippancy as first because I've
    always kind of equated\n    it with \"quick\". However, it's more of a \"quickness\"
    paired with a total\n    lack of respect/awareness for/of X.\n\n!!! warning \"churches\"\n\n
    \   Are there areas in the church where we are flippant (specifically with humor
    I guess?)\n\n## Chapter 12\n\n!!! danger \"page 57-58\"\n\n    As long as he retains

# Chapters

Below are just quick notes or quotes from each chapter as a reminder of what to
go back to chat about. This isn't intended to be in-depth by any stretch.

## Chapter 1

"Your man has been accustomed, ever since he was a boy, to have a dozen
incompatible philosophies dancing about together inside his head. He doesn't
think of doctrines as primarily 'true' or 'false', but as 'academic' or
'practical', 'outworn' or 'contemporary', 'conventional' or 'ruthless'"

## Chapter 2

## Chapter 3

pg 11. Keeping the patient's mind focused on the 'inner life' so his actions do
not ever reflect his conversion

pg 12. Creating an imaginary person for whom to pray... "In time, you may get
the cleavage so wide that no thought or feeling from his prayers for the
imagined mother will ever flow over into his treatment of the real one"

pg 13-14. "Let him assume that she knows how annoying it is and does it to
annoy - if you know your job he will not notice the immense improbability of
the assumption" -> This point is particularly convicting to me

!!! background-thought ""

    The last point about encouraging the patient to interpret the mother's every
    move in an over-sensitive fashion is actually very relatable for me

## Chapter 4

pg 15. Convincing the patient that scheduled prayer is wrong and that he must
create a _mood_ within himself for real prayer reminds me of high school youth
groups talking about "praying in the spirit" and silly conversation "combating
salvation by works" ideas like scheduled prayer times.

pg 16. "they constantly forget, what you must always remember, that they are
animals and that whatever their bodies do affects their souls" 👈 feels a lot
like Genesis 3, and humans are never more human than when we exercise
self-control.

pg. 16. "Keep them watching their own minds and trying to produce _feelings_
there by the action of their own wills"

!!! background-thought ""

    I totally remember feeling like I needed to want to pray in order for my
    prayers to matter

pg 17. "When they say they re praying for forgiveness, let them be trying to
feel forgiven"

pg 18. "But whatever the nature of the composite object, you must keep him
praying to _it_ - to the thing that he has made, not to the Person who has made
him"

!!! background-thought ""

    Lewis talking actual idolatry with meaningful consequences... not the "money
    is my idol" take most pastors preach

## Chapter 5

pg 23. "...while tens of thousands who do not go so far as that will
nevertheless have their attention diverted from themselves to values and causes
which they believe to be higher than the self. I know that the Enemy
disapproves many of these causes. But that is where He is so unfair. He often
makes prizes of humans who have given their lives for causes He think bad on
the monstrously sophistical ground that the humans thought them good and were
following the best they knew"

!!! warning "WARNING TITLE"

    This reminds me of the young Tarkan in Narnia: The Last Battle, who Aslan
    ascribes all his good deeds done to Tash as done to himself - effectively
    saying the Tarkan's loyalty to the wrong god is honored by Aslan? Definitely
    want to know more about Lewis' thoughts there and here in Screwtape

## Chapter 6

pg 25. "There is nothing like suspense and anxiety for barricading a human's
mind against the Enemy."

!!! warning ""

    Screwtape's point in the beinning of the chapter confuses me... He instructs
    Wormwood to keep the man thinking that the things he is anxious about, the
    things themselves, are his trials/cross to bear, rather than the anxiety
    itself. So from the Christian perspective, Lewis seems to be saying that the
    real-time, present, acute anxiety and suspense in the man's heart regarding the
    war is the actual trial and cross... not the things the man is anxious about. I
    don't know what to do with this but it _feels_ convicting to me. Growing up I
    often had the thought that nothing could be wrong because "I have Jesus", and I
    would look at my circumstances as things to bear - for me the biggest one was
    singleness. So would Lewis say my outlook on my singleness as the thing to
    bear, rather than the anxiety about being single, was the enemy twisting my
    convictions to be inward rather than God-ward? It clearly looks like my
    convictions were inward, but I'm not sure I understand how seeing the anxiety
    itself as my "cross to bare" is any more Biblical...

## Chapter 7

page 32. "The fact that 'devils' are predominately _comic_ figures in the
modern imagination will help you"

!!! background-thought ""

    I think It's funny because I bet most people, myself included, reading this book (at
    least the first time) have a red-devil type figure in mind for Screwtape or
    Wormwood

page 31-32. "If once we can produce our perfect work -- the Materialist
Magician, the man, not using, but veritably worshipping, what he vaguely called
'Froces' while denying the existence of 'spirits' -- then the end of the war
will be in sight."

!!! background-thought ""

  I hear some non-Christian friends say things like "I'm spiritual so I
  appreciate your prayers". In a sense they believe in some kind of
  non-physical "thing" but not in any real sense so it looks, to me, similar to
  what Screwtape longs for in his letter to Wormwood.

page 32. "All extremes, except extreme deviotion to the Enemy, are to be
encouraged... Other ages, of which the present is one, are unbalanced and prone
to faction, and it is our business to inflame them"

!!! background-thought ""

    Using Christianity to justify political positions or judgement seems right
    here. Extreme devotion to our God I don't think should offend people as often
    or to the degree that many Christians think is right... People flocked to
    Jesus, only the religious elite and politically powerful hated him. When
    Christianity is mixed with anything other than itself, that's when it becomes
    offensive. I think I see people hold to something like Christian Nationalism,
    and the offensive nature of it justifies the position because "we were always
    going to be persecured for loving Jesus"

!!! danger "page 34"

    Let him begin by treating the Patriotism or the Pacifism as a part of his
    religion. Then let him, under then influence of partisan spirit, come to
    regard it as the most important part...

## Chapter 8

!!! success "page 39"

    For He cannot ravish. He can only woo.

!!! note "page 40"

    He wants them to learn to walk and must therefore take away His hand; and
    if only the will to walk is really there He is pleased even with their
    stumbles

## Chapter 9

page 43. "In the first place I have always found that the trough periods of the
human undulation provide excellen opportunity for all sensual tempations,
particularly those of sex... The attack has a much better chance of success
when the man's whole innter world is drab and cold and empty."

!!! background-thought ""

    I feel this observation in my own life deeply - in my 'troughs' I'm drawn to
    pleasurable things in a very unpleasurable way

!!! success "page 44"

    Never forget that when we are dealing with any pleasure in its healthy and
    normal and satisfying form, we are, in a sense, on the Enemy's ground.

!!! danger "jargon not wisdom"

    Of course there is no conceivable way of getting by reason from the
    proposition 'I am losing interest in this' to the proposition 'This is
    false'/ But, as I said before, it is jargon, not reason, you must rely on.

## Chapter 10

page 49. "Did he commit himself deeply? I don't mean the words. There is a
subtle play of looks and tons and laughs by which a mortal can imply that he is
of the same party as those to whom he is speaking"

!!! background-thought ""

    I resonate with the temptation Scretape is basically instructing Wormwood to
    employ - two-facedness/double-life. In hs/college in particular I would 'play
    the part' to fit in to a particular crowd. I'd rarely confess Christianity
    early on, would never deny it explicitly, but would act and talk in a
    way/about things to imply that I was not necessarily non-Christian, but
    instead nothing to ask about.

    Chapter 10 in overall convicting as it just drives home the point I noted
    just now.... that I'm very prone to 'acting' in order to fit into a community

## Chatper 11

page 55. "The real use of Joke or Humour is in quite a different direction, and
it is specially promising among the English who take their 'sense of humour' so
seriously that a deficiency in this sense is almost the only deficiency at
which they feel shame. Humour is for them the all-consoling and (mark this) the
all-excusing, grace of life"

!!! danger "all-excusing grace of life"

    Humour is for them the all-consoling and (mark this) the all-excusing,
    grace of life

!!! background-thought ""

    Basically I understand Lewis to be saying here that men (or the English in
    particular) take great pride in having a sense of humor - so much so that
    humor becomes an excuse to laugh at anything. When anything is worth laughing
    at, then I think it's very hard to prioritize things above others - becuase
    if everything is a joke, is anything really worthy of more than a joke?

!!! warning "Flippancy"

    I didn't understand flippancy as first because I've always kind of equated
    it with "quick". However, it's more of a "quickness" paired with a total
    lack of respect/awareness for/of X.

!!! warning "churches"

    Are there areas in the church where we are flippant (specifically with humor I guess?)

## Chapter 12

!!! danger "page 57-58"

    As long as he retains externally the habits of a Christian he can still be
    made to think of himself as one who has adopted a few new friends and
    amusements but whose spiritual state is much the same as it was six weeks
    ago.

page 58. [The dim uneasiness about `backsliding` Screwtape describes in the
chapter] increases the patient's reluctance to think about the Enemy.

    This is too real for me - in seasons of rebellion, and honestly anytime I
    fall away from "Christian habits" I notice that I am actually reluctant to

    this is God's grace poured out on me

    embarrassment hate the very sight of a pass-book.

Particularly a challenging chapter. It's interesting to think about pleasurable
things, for their own sake and not enjoyed outside the boundaires set for
pleasure by God, are harmful to our enemy's tactics. I do not know if I enjoy
things for their own sake enough or rightly....

!!! warning ""

    Do my tech hobbies make me more human or less by distracting me from holier
    things...

## Chapter 14

!!! warning "page 69"

    All virtues are less formidable to us once the man is aware that he has
    them, but this is specially true of humility.

## Chapter 16

!!! note "page 81"

    In the first place the parochial organisation [Church] should always be
    attacked, because, being a _unity of place and not of likings_, it brings
    people of different classes and psychology together in the kind of unity
    the Enemy desires

!!! danger "page 82-83"

    In order to spare the laity all 'difficulties' he has deserted both the
    lectionary and the appointed psalms and now, without noticing it, revoles
    endlessly round the little treadmill of his fifteen favourite psalms and
    twenty favorite lessons.

## Chapter 17

!!! background-thought ""

    Gluttony of Delicacy, not gluttony of Excess

!!! danger "page 88"

    You see? Because what she wants is smaller and less costly than what has
    been set before her, she never recognises as gluttony her determination to
    get what she wants, however troublesome it may be to others

## Chapter 18

Screwtape's lack of understanding,and arrogant questioning, of the Enemy's
_love_ is a hilarious commentary on humans who stand staunchly opposed to
Yahweh. Academic peers of mine, with such amazing pride, speaking aginst the
Biblical narrative because _it doesn't make sense_... Lewis makes a good point
through Screwtape "Members of His faction have frequently admitted that if ever
we [demons] came to understand what He means by love, the war would be over and
we should re-enter Heaven". I think Lewis' point dovetails with the idea that
Jesus is actually very compelling and the rubbish about him being offensive is
a replay of the Gospels - where the rich and elite are the ones offended, not
the people he calls to the kingdom. Jesus' love doesn't make sense to those who
have everything they think they need... His love is for those who know they are
lowly
