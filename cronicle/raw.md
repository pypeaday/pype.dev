I use [hcio](https://healthchecks.io) to monitor a few of my backup scripts and when LLMs hit the scene I got interested to try to build my own. I have a pretty good understanding of systems, and I enjoy thinking through them, but I'm not a great front-end designer - AI has helped a bit in that regard.

Cronicle isn't live anywhere yet, and it's undergone a few revisions already. I'm not sure if I'll continue with it, but I'm having fun thinking through it.
