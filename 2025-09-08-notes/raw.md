## Reflection

- Discussed with Andrew the discomfort I felt this morning reading Spurgeon's
reflection on Hosea 14:8
  - The basic takeaways from that are commentary and reflection are different,
  and reflection isn't expository teaching
  - I have a significant sensitivity to putting thoughts on the Bible out there
  for people to misinterpret, I blog here but hopefully no one comes to any of
  my posts with "Reflection" in the title and expects theological education...
  - So this is a good thing to think about, or just be aware of in future
  conversations - "devotional" is a very common word in Christian circles but
  this morning it became clear that I have had a slightly different definition
  than perhaps most of my Christian counterparts (not that my understanding was
  correct - in fact it became clear this morning that it isn't)
  - Overall though, by God's grace, his Word does speak to people differently,
  and although we should exercise caution with any application, I cannot deny
  that God speaks to others in ways that he doesn't speak to me, and praise God
  he loves us enough to reach out in ways appropriate for each individual
