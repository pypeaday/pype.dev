            <p>We are quickly becomming a Great Wolf Lodge family... we've got several times
over the last couple years, and I only forsee more going forward for the next
5-8 years or so. We also travel to see family every now and then and so when we
do I'm in charge of kid's entertainment... Normally we use a simple setup for
each kid that basically consists of an old android phone with syncthing and
VLC...</p>
<p>In my homelab I host an instance of tdarr which is a tool batch processing
media files - say you have a folder of tv shows encoded in h.264 and you want
to re-encode to h.265 for space savings - tdarr is a great tool. So what I do
is configure a &quot;library&quot; in tdarr (basically a folder of media), and then I
hand-select the tv shows or movies the kids might want for the trip into that
folder. tdarr compresses the media quite a bit and then that folder is also the
syncthing back-end so the compressed media is just automatically updated and
synced to the phones when on our home network.</p>
<p>This has allowed me to put almost anything the girls might want onto hand-held
devices that fit in their backpacks and will work without an internet
connection!</p>
