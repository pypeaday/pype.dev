yesterday: [[2025-11-25-notes]]

- started a post about considering others' points - used speakr to transcribe
- [[reflection-ecclesiastes-9-10]]

## Dev

- FINALLY setup something closer to a tiling window manager at home... Using
  Aurora still, kind of thinking about a switch there too, but I found
  [KZones](https://github.com/gerritdevriese/kzones) which is like
  WindowsFancyZones which is close enough for me for now... I don't move windows
  around a ton at home and the little I do I don't mind using a mouse to snap
  into place

  - Also saw [Fluid Tle](https://codeberg.org/Serroda/fluid-tile) which I
    considered and may try out after I get some tiling done on Mac with
    [AeroSpace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace)

- Aerospace is configured on my Mac, dotfiles updated in forgejo... feels
  awesome to have some simple tiling and navigation

## Keys

- super + {1-9} for switching workspaces
  - on Aurora at home I have this for virtual desktops... the difference is
    that virtual desktops contain both monitors whereas workspaces in aerospace
    are assigned a monitor - which I prefer
- super + shift + {1-9} assigns a window to that workspace and sends it there
  - don't have this at home, I use way more browser windows at home than work
    so I'll just plan to mouse around the KZones when I'm getting setup and
    keyboard nav from there
- there's a few things for full screen and swapping focus and stuff... all in
  all very basic but a clean experience

## Next

- worktrees has to come next....
