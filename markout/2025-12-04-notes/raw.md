## Misc

- Many things are helping and hurting my focus lately, but I feel aware of them...

  - Scrolling... Obviously the worst thing
  - Mushrooms are helping so much
    - FOCUS blend from FourSigmatic is doing great - specifically the
      supplement, not just the coffee
    - Going to up the Lion's Mane and Cordyceps over the next few weeks to see
      what I notice
  - I **think** it's easier for me to focus when I am comfortable, and a
    weighted hoodie was recommended to me so I finally purchased a comfrt one,
    we'll see how that goes
