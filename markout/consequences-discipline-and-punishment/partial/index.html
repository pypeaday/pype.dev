            <p>I'm a dad and I have 2 beautiful daughters in my house right now. As they've
grown up just a little from new-born to toddler to child, my wife and I have
worked hard to have the right posture and attitude towards &quot;discipline&quot;. I have
noticed that 3 words seem to kind of meld into each other and I prefer they
have clear boundaries, because in our household we're very intentional to not
punish... Punishment is a heavy and weighty thing and we don't want our kids to
grow up thinking they get punished for messing up.</p>
<p>Kids certainly <strong>know</strong> right and wrong to some degree, and even when they
knowingly do something &quot;bad&quot; it's not necessarily that there was malicious
intent behind it... In my mind - 'punishment' is for malpractice, but erroring
and making an unwise choice to &quot;do something bad&quot; is a lack of judgement and
that doesn't require punishment, it should illicit discipline.</p>
<p>Why be so pedantic about these 2 words in particular? Well because I don't
think it's appropriate for my daughters to believe they get punished for
singing at the table... There's nothing morally wrong with that, but we do need
them to focus on meals at meal time, so we practice being disciplined at the
table. If they continue to sing, we utilitze consequences but they are never
penal. What I mean is that if my kids are singing, being loud, etc. at the
table, we have them run laps outside or do jumping jacks. Why? Because getting
that excess energy out is a way for them to discipline their bodies, and learn
to be self-controlled. There's no element of fear or of losing something
because they're struggling to contain themselves while we eat.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">punishment vs discipline</p>
<p>That's the key difference and it's taken several years for me to really drive a
wedge between &quot;punishment&quot; and &quot;discipline&quot; even in my own worldview as a
parent. So our language with our kids is &quot;obey the rules or we will do some
discipline&quot; - never &quot;or you will be punished&quot;.</p>
</div>
<p>Do you see the difference in how that frames even the obedience and the rule
itself? It's not a thing to follow out of fear, rules are to be followed
<strong>because it's right</strong> and to do what is right requires discipline and
self-control. There is no need (actually there's not even an appropriate place)
for <strong>punishment</strong> in this context.</p>
<p>So what of consequences? Well, sometimes punishment is a consequence, sometimes
running laps is a consequence, sometimes getting hurt from falling out of a
tree you weren't supposed to be climbing that high in is a consequence...
Consequences are amoral things that happen after something else. But
consequences presented without a framework for understanding them can sort of
make them meaningless.</p>
<p>For a while I would tell my girls that &quot;there will be consequences for
disobeying&quot;, but this isn't enough - this doesn't explain <em>why</em> there are
consequenes, it only encoruages obedience to avoid <strong>punishment</strong> rather than
obedience <strong>because it is right</strong>.</p>
<p>So that's a short parenting note that I've been musing on - kids need to grow
up learning how to be disciplined and how to be self-controlled. Raising them
to avoid punishment teaches nothing about the socieatal expectation of
appropriate behavior but rather puts them in a position of just trying to avoid
something uncomfortable. That doesn't raise them towards something good, it
only teaches them to avoid something else.</p>
<p>If instead my children understand <strong>that it is important</strong> to be a disciplined
human, it fosters a relatonship of help and love between us. My job isn't to
punish my kids for misbehaving, it's to raise them to be disciplined,
honorable, well-meaning people in a society. If I'm their teacher and guide
then that journey is filled with learning and love. If I only arbitrate justice
through negative consequences and punishment, then what room is there in their
hearts to love me as their dad if they're always afraid I'm going to punish
them for something?</p>
