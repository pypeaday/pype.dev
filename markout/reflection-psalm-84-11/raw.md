Spurgeon's Morning and Evening today (actually the evening one) is for [Psalm 84:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+84%3A11&version=ESV).

!!! note "Psalm 84:11"

    Psalm 84:11 (LEB): 11 Because Yahweh God is a sun and a shield;  Yahweh gives grace and honor.  He does not withhold good from those who walk blamelessly.

What is it to me to hear and know that **Yahweh gives grace and honor**? I'm asking this because Spurgon's meditation this morning has a particularly striking line in it

> The little conjunction “and” in this verse is a diamond rivet binding the present with the future: grace and glory always go together.

The translation he was using has "glory", I quoted "honor". The word is `כָּבוֹד`
(kabod) which generally basically means "weight".

I got very distracted this morning unfortunately and therefore my reflection
will be cut short... I know meditating on these things opens my day up to go in
a better direction... May Yahweh give grace to me today, to live in a glorified
and honorable way... one worthy of the gospel of Christ.

!!! note "Philippians 1:27"

    Whatever happens, conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ. Then, whether I come and see you or only hear about you in my absence, I will know that you stand firm in the one Spirit, striving together as one for the faith of the gospel
