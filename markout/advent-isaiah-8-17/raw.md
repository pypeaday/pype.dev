!!! note "Isaiah 8:17"

    And I will wait for Yahweh,  who hides his face from the house of Jacob,  and I will await him.

`I will await him` -> this isn't "waiting" like being patient... The first
"wait" is, but the second "wait" isn't the same word. Seems like a few English
translations are pick something along the lines of patience rather than
expectation here...

I'm not an expert, but I do think `hope` is a better translation - part of that
influence is that it's the first day's reflection from this BP Advent Calendar
and this first week of Advent is about "Hope".

"Hoping" isn't just being patient - it's **expecting** what you are being
patient, it's longing for that thing to come, it's excited anticipation.

I'm in a short season of stress and waiting - but waiting for things that I
don't really want to happen, to happen... I pray in the Advent season Jesus will
keep my thoughts and hopes on him and not on the circumstances that are just as
imminent as His coming, albeit probably sooner.
