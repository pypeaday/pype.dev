content: 'Yesterday''s [[reflection-contentment-and-work]] has a second-part this
  morning.

  As I was wrapping up a project I didn''t realize the closed-off-ness of

  leaving... I handed in some notes, and mid-message to someone the clock struck

  midnight and I was locked out. It''s fitting to be honest, and now in the wake

  of yesterday''s contentment post, experiencing some more loss than I expected,

  today we forge ahead.


  My main focus for work now is a project I will refer to as `forge`. It is what

  I will bring to Caterpillar Autonomy but I can only build it thanks to the

  gifts and experience God has given me. The thing I want to put on paper is a

  short list of experiences I think God in his sovereignty, gave me over the last

  few years and what they provide for me for Forge.


  ## Cat Reman Platform


  One of the first things that comes to mind is another project I was sad to

  lose: a platform I started for an analytics team in Cat Reman. That began as a

  simple python cli to automate some developer operations that was otherwise a

  dozen clicks through the AWS console. Using [boto3] and some simple python I

  gave that team the start of some real velocity gains. Eventually that grew into

  a larger kubernetes-based service where the data science operations: code quality,

  deployment, updates, webapps, etc. were all handled by our platform. It wasn''t

  perfect, it wasn''t self-contained, it was a set of things kind of glued

  together with systems and scripts, but it worked, it works today and is under

  fantastic ownership.


  What I learned just from starting that cli was to be passionate about solving

  problems. No one asked me to make it, but it needed made, and the team is in

  such a better place for me having started it.


  ## Kedro and OpenShift


  Another short project I was able to participate in a few years ago was leading

  a data-syncronization task into a fiery horrific crash that lasted weeks -

  neigh months longer - than was necessary or appropriate... The details aren''t

  relevant - I was the lead dev in a new place tasks with syncing up data between

  2 applications. Ultimately, could''ve been a python script but I over-designed a

  kedro-based solution because of some requirements I misunderstood. Part of that

  misunderstanding was not knowing how to get the requirements I needed, but they

  weren''t provided in full, I didn''t know any better, so for weeks we were a

  corporate meme trying to use python to update a database that no one on our

  team understood if we were allowed to write to.... It was very confusing.


  But what I learned was a lot about gathering requirements, questioning

  assumptions, and the importance of understanding your constraints as fully as

  possible as early as possible.


  ## A Real Platform


  Then one of the biggest blessings I see for Forge, is the experience I''ve

  gotten recently with AWS at scale... Not 1 or 2 services created with

  Medium.com copy pasta tutorials from docs... but experience working in a large

  project across many accounts, supporting several teams, using a wide variety of

  technologies from Terraform to Kubernetes.


  On this project I learned about practical system design and gained a lot of

  confidence in supporting systems that are complicated... I''m not the smartest

  guy in the world but I''m no dummy, and even while lacking fluency in the system

  I was supporting on this project I learned a lot of troubleshooting skills and

  gained confidence in my ability to troubleshoot complex systems.


  I''ll need this for Forge - which will break certainly, but I''ll be there to fix

  it and I''m sure I can because I''ve done these other things.


  ## Fin


  The Lord has been with me through these projects - he has certainly blessed me

  with a skillset and personality that lends itself to being really useful in the

  Tech world I''ve landed in (which is a whole ''nother story of God''s sovereignty

  and provision). I am very grateful for the swath of experience I''ve gotten over

  the last 8 years or so, and this season I''m in of change is rocking me a little

  more than I anticipated but by God''s grace I think I see the purpose, or at

  least **a** purpose, and I pray I am making the choices for work he wants me to

  make.'

    that comes to mind is another project I was sad to\nlose: a platform I started
    for an analytics team in Cat Reman. That began as a\nsimple python cli to automate
    some developer operations that was otherwise a\ndozen clicks through the AWS console.
    Using [boto3] and some simple python I\ngave that team the start of some real
    velocity gains. Eventually that grew into\na larger kubernetes-based service where
    the data science operations: code quality,\ndeployment, updates, webapps, etc.
    were all handled by our platform. It wasn't\nperfect, it wasn't self-contained,
    it was a set of things kind of glued\ntogether with systems and scripts, but it
    worked, it works today and is under\nfantastic ownership.</p>\n<p>What I learned
    just from starting that cli was to be passionate about solving\nproblems. No one
    asked me to make it, but it needed made, and the team is in\nsuch a better place
    for me having started it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kedro-and-openshift\">Kedro and OpenShift

    I was able to participate in a few years ago was leading\na data-syncronization
    task into a fiery horrific crash that lasted weeks -\nneigh months longer - than
    was necessary or appropriate... The details aren't\nrelevant - I was the lead
    dev in a new place tasks with syncing up data between\n2 applications. Ultimately,
    could've been a python script but I over-designed a\nkedro-based solution because
    of some requirements I misunderstood. Part of that\nmisunderstanding was not knowing
    how to get the requirements I needed, but they\nweren't provided in full, I didn't
    know any better, so for weeks we were a\ncorporate meme trying to use python to
    update a database that no one on our\nteam understood if we were allowed to write
    to.... It was very confusing.</p>\n<p>But what I learned was a lot about gathering
    requirements, questioning\nassumptions, and the importance of understanding your
    constraints as fully as\npossible as early as possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-real-platform\">A

    blessings I see for Forge, is the experience I've\ngotten recently with AWS at
    scale... Not 1 or 2 services created with\n<a href=\"http://Medium.com\">Medium.com</a>
    copy pasta tutorials from docs... but experience working in a large\nproject across
    many accounts, supporting several teams, using a wide variety of\ntechnologies
    from Terraform to Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>On this project I learned about practical
    system design and gained a lot of\nconfidence in supporting systems that are complicated...
    I'm not the smartest\nguy in the world but I'm no dummy, and even while lacking
    fluency in the system\nI was supporting on this project I learned a lot of troubleshooting
    skills and\ngained confidence in my ability to troubleshoot complex systems.</p>\n<p>I'll
    need this for Forge - which will break certainly, but I'll be there to fix\nit
    and I'm sure I can because I've done these other things.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fin\">Fin

    has a second-part this morning.\nAs I was wrapping up a project I didn't realize
    the closed-off-ness of\nleaving... I handed in some notes, and mid-message to
    someone the clock struck\nmidnight and I was locked out. It's fitting to be honest,
    and now in the wake\nof yesterday's contentment post, experiencing some more loss
    than I expected,\ntoday we forge ahead.</p>\n<p>My main focus for work now is
    a project I will refer to as <code>forge</code>. It is what\nI will bring to Caterpillar
    Autonomy but I can only build it thanks to the\ngifts and experience God has given
    me. The thing I want to put on paper is a\nshort list of experiences I think God
    in his sovereignty, gave me over the last\nfew years and what they provide for
    me for Forge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cat-reman-platform\">Cat Reman Platform <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    that comes to mind is another project I was sad to\nlose: a platform I started
    for an analytics team in Cat Reman. That began as a\nsimple python cli to automate
    some developer operations that was otherwise a\ndozen clicks through the AWS console.
    Using [boto3] and some simple python I\ngave that team the start of some real
    velocity gains. Eventually that grew into\na larger kubernetes-based service where
    the data science operations: code quality,\ndeployment, updates, webapps, etc.
    were all handled by our platform. It wasn't\nperfect, it wasn't self-contained,
    it was a set of things kind of glued\ntogether with systems and scripts, but it
    worked, it works today and is under\nfantastic ownership.</p>\n<p>What I learned
    just from starting that cli was to be passionate about solving\nproblems. No one
    asked me to make it, but it needed made, and the team is in\nsuch a better place
    for me having started it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"kedro-and-openshift\">Kedro and OpenShift

    I was able to participate in a few years ago was leading\na data-syncronization
    task into a fiery horrific crash that lasted weeks -\nneigh months longer - than
    was necessary or appropriate... The details aren't\nrelevant - I was the lead
    dev in a new place tasks with syncing up data between\n2 applications. Ultimately,
    could've been a python script but I over-designed a\nkedro-based solution because
    of some requirements I misunderstood. Part of that\nmisunderstanding was not knowing
    how to get the requirements I needed, but they\nweren't provided in full, I didn't
    know any better, so for weeks we were a\ncorporate meme trying to use python to
    update a database that no one on our\nteam understood if we were allowed to write
    to.... It was very confusing.</p>\n<p>But what I learned was a lot about gathering
    requirements, questioning\nassumptions, and the importance of understanding your
    constraints as fully as\npossible as early as possible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-real-platform\">A

    blessings I see for Forge, is the experience I've\ngotten recently with AWS at
    scale... Not 1 or 2 services created with\n<a href=\"http://Medium.com\">Medium.com</a>
    copy pasta tutorials from docs... but experience working in a large\nproject across
    many accounts, supporting several teams, using a wide variety of\ntechnologies
    from Terraform to Kubernetes.</p>\n<p>On this project I learned about practical
    system design and gained a lot of\nconfidence in supporting systems that are complicated...
    I'm not the smartest\nguy in the world but I'm no dummy, and even while lacking
    fluency in the system\nI was supporting on this project I learned a lot of troubleshooting
    skills and\ngained confidence in my ability to troubleshoot complex systems.</p>\n<p>I'll
    need this for Forge - which will break certainly, but I'll be there to fix\nit
    and I'm sure I can because I've done these other things.</p>\n<h2 id=\"fin\">Fin

---

Yesterday's [[reflection-contentment-and-work]] has a second-part this morning.
As I was wrapping up a project I didn't realize the closed-off-ness of
leaving... I handed in some notes, and mid-message to someone the clock struck
midnight and I was locked out. It's fitting to be honest, and now in the wake
of yesterday's contentment post, experiencing some more loss than I expected,
today we forge ahead.

My main focus for work now is a project I will refer to as `forge`. It is what
I will bring to Caterpillar Autonomy but I can only build it thanks to the
gifts and experience God has given me. The thing I want to put on paper is a
short list of experiences I think God in his sovereignty, gave me over the last
few years and what they provide for me for Forge.

## Cat Reman Platform

One of the first things that comes to mind is another project I was sad to
lose: a platform I started for an analytics team in Cat Reman. That began as a
simple python cli to automate some developer operations that was otherwise a
dozen clicks through the AWS console. Using [boto3] and some simple python I
gave that team the start of some real velocity gains. Eventually that grew into
a larger kubernetes-based service where the data science operations: code quality,
deployment, updates, webapps, etc. were all handled by our platform. It wasn't
perfect, it wasn't self-contained, it was a set of things kind of glued
together with systems and scripts, but it worked, it works today and is under
fantastic ownership.

What I learned just from starting that cli was to be passionate about solving
problems. No one asked me to make it, but it needed made, and the team is in
such a better place for me having started it.

## Kedro and OpenShift

Another short project I was able to participate in a few years ago was leading
a data-syncronization task into a fiery horrific crash that lasted weeks -
neigh months longer - than was necessary or appropriate... The details aren't
relevant - I was the lead dev in a new place tasks with syncing up data between
2 applications. Ultimately, could've been a python script but I over-designed a
kedro-based solution because of some requirements I misunderstood. Part of that
misunderstanding was not knowing how to get the requirements I needed, but they
weren't provided in full, I didn't know any better, so for weeks we were a
corporate meme trying to use python to update a database that no one on our
team understood if we were allowed to write to.... It was very confusing.

But what I learned was a lot about gathering requirements, questioning
assumptions, and the importance of understanding your constraints as fully as
possible as early as possible.

## A Real Platform

Then one of the biggest blessings I see for Forge, is the experience I've
gotten recently with AWS at scale... Not 1 or 2 services created with
Medium.com copy pasta tutorials from docs... but experience working in a large
project across many accounts, supporting several teams, using a wide variety of
technologies from Terraform to Kubernetes.

On this project I learned about practical system design and gained a lot of
confidence in supporting systems that are complicated... I'm not the smartest
guy in the world but I'm no dummy, and even while lacking fluency in the system
I was supporting on this project I learned a lot of troubleshooting skills and
gained confidence in my ability to troubleshoot complex systems.

I'll need this for Forge - which will break certainly, but I'll be there to fix
it and I'm sure I can because I've done these other things.

## Fin

The Lord has been with me through these projects - he has certainly blessed me
with a skillset and personality that lends itself to being really useful in the
Tech world I've landed in (which is a whole 'nother story of God's sovereignty
and provision). I am very grateful for the swath of experience I've gotten over
the last 8 years or so, and this season I'm in of change is rocking me a little
more than I anticipated but by God's grace I think I see the purpose, or at
least **a** purpose, and I pray I am making the choices for work he wants me to
make.
