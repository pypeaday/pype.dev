## Daily

- Went to BJJ yesterday for the first time since late December... you definitely feel 6 weeks off not only in the cardio, but also in the everything-else... body is **sore** today

## Reflection

- Spent some time meditating on 2 Peter 3:18 - "... To [Jesus] be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity"
  - It's the **now** that's on my heart, I am bordering on feeling like I'm on a mission from God himself at work, and to do that mission for the glory of the Lord **today** sure brings motivation and passion to the problem solving

## Tech

- [MinIO Archived](https://github.com/minio/minio)
  - Time to look at [Garage](https://git.deuxfleurs.fr/Deuxfleurs/garage)
  - or [RustFS](https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs)
