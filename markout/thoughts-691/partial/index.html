<p>Here's my thought on <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/normal-boyhood-is-adhd-a9593488">💭 Normal boyhood is ADHD</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I may want to write a longer post about this or just capture some quick thoughts but I appreciate DHH's take here.... ADHD <em>diagnosis</em> is an epidemic... Humans are different and I think we should seek to build society that makes space for differences, rather than medicating everyone into more or less the same robotic blog to work and pay taxes.</p>
<p>However I came across this post on another platform with commenting, and most of the commentators were upset with the post saying things like &quot;tell me you have no idea what ADHD is without telling me&quot; and long explanation of honestly regurgitated talking points from a very pro-pharma worldview position... it's kind of a chicken or egg thing to me - because you don't have to be a doctor to read and do your own research, and to &quot;just trust the experts&quot; is the most unscientific saying in history... but the folks criticizing this post claiming DHH is speaking out of turn are taking JUST as arrogant approach to ADHD or mental health, only they put more faith in a medical community (which I've written about a little and am sus of due to the money), but they put ZERO faith in their own ability to think critically or observe patterns about the world...</p>
<p>Thanks DHH for the thoughts here, as a guy recently diagnosed with ADHD and Autism I've done my own reflection and simply agree with a lot of what he puts down here</p>
