<p>Linux Matters mentioned some song visualizers and one of the hosts even wrote
one... I've recently been lamenting that I'm not very good at doing something
&quot;just for me&quot;, I always need an angle and this is a pretty annoying mental
battle that I'm in the middle of practically all the time. But I loved
visualizers as a kid, Windows Media Player + Limewire was a match made in
heaven. So, I'm gonna toss <a href="">this visualizer</a> onto a screen today with my
tunes</p>

<p>Messed around with Cloudflare Tunnels today finally. Sweet little piece of
tech. I'm going to use it for hosting notifiq. I got my tunnel setup with
terraform which is awesome - I will bring that into my homelab infrastructure
module and clean it all up since I took a look tonight after several months and
oh boy have I learned a thing or 2 about terraform in that time...</p>
