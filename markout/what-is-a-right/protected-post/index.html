<p>I saw something this morning that kind of irk'd me so I thought I'd write some
thoughts on it... It was one of those maps of countries and the results of a
poll. The poll what &quot;Is food a human right?&quot; and like every country except USA
voted &quot;yes&quot; and we voted &quot;no&quot; - ie. Americans hate people... obviously...</p>
<p>Obviously that's ridiculous... or it obvious to me anyways... But the
ridiculousness of the graphic aside, it's the baseline question that got me
thinking...</p>

<p>The thing is - you <em>can not</em> be <strong>entitled</strong> to the labor of another human
being... I think this is axiomatic, and I know there are large groups of people
who disagree, but I would call every one of those groups <strong>inhumane</strong>.</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">My Right Trumps Your Freedom</p>
<p>If my right requires that another person works, then that person is not
free... sounds familiar, ya?</p>
</div>
<p>So with the understanding that I have ZERO regard for a worldview that thinks
some humans can force labor on another group of humans - let's talk about what
a right is.</p>
<p>A right is something all humans have the ability to do AND at the same time is
a thing that CAN BE defended</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Ultimately, rights are just force</p>
</div>
<p>Note I'm not saying all humans have to agree on the thing, nor am I saying that
it MUST BE defended to be a right, but if something can forcefully be taken away
then I think the verbiage of calling it a &quot;right&quot; is nothing more than
emotional argumentation.</p>
<p>I want all people to have clean drinking water, the ability to work and make a
life for themselves, the freedom to express creativity, and also food to eat...
I want these things for all humans, but calling anything of them a &quot;right&quot; on
their own is either deeply misguided or, as noted above, axiomatic to a
worldview that is essentially pro-slavery. The simpleton thinking about
&quot;rights&quot; is doing  the world, and our country specifically no favors in public
discourse...</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">For Example</p>
<p>I hear that Trump's administration is &quot;taking away basic human rights&quot; and
I've had the privilege of asking a few people what they mean... Either nothing
or abortion. The nothing crowd is led astray by a misguided narrative, and
the abortion crowd simply denies the humanity of the unborn. They would
deny the humanity of any group of humans they can eliminate or enslave for
their own gain. Ironically it's in restoring the idea of liberty from the
government that I think this WH administration is actually doing a good job of
defending huamn rights - and by civil necessity that means the rights of
citizens primarily.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a reality of our broken world is that <em>might makes right</em>. ie.
the Strong make the rules for the Weak, and if the Strong don't protect the
Weak's ability, say to eat, then the language of a &quot;right to food&quot; has
absolutely zero weight.</p>
<p>Let me say plainly that I don't subscribe to a worldview where &quot;might makes
right&quot; is appropriate - I believe Jesus will come back to judge the living and
the dead, and that his people (ie. the Church) should work the world for the
betterment of all people. But while I believe this and live my life in this
direction - I recognize the functional reality that the only things you &quot;have a
right to&quot; are the things you can protect.</p>
<p>This is one reason I've come to appreciate America so much. It isn't that our
country demonstrates every moral conviction I have, or even that it was founded
on &quot;Christian Principals&quot; (history is hard), but our country was founded on a
principal that all people have inalienable rights... But those rights are
recognized in our country because our country can and does defend those liberties.</p>
<p>If no one will defend you, you functionally have a right to nothing - to argue
otherwise is to be needlessly pedantic in a conversation that must revolve around
<em>practicality</em> to be useful</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p>It's high-time some political activists start thinking pragmatically
instead of spewing emotional language into a field they probably have no
business being in (besides those sweet sweet lobby-dollars of course)</p>

<p>So... what's the point? I think I'm saying we should just speak honestly about
our world, because emotional and vague language is actually not helpful... To
that end, honestly many many people need to practice silence in the public
sector - the internet has made everyone an expert commentator on the
current thing, and it's destroying actual rhetoric.</p>
<p>And although I can't say &quot;all humans have a right to food&quot; because not all
humans have their ability to obtain and eat food protected, I absolutely
believe all humans should have this ability of theirs protected. This
conclusion can't be expressed in a simple map created undoubtedly to
perpetuate political anger and division...</p>
<p>So go out there and protect the weaker person's &quot;right&quot; to whatever you feel is
being wrongly taken from them - but if you can't protect it then either vote
for someone who will or frankly quit talking...</p>
