Yahweh is king

!!! note "Psalm 93"

    93  Yahweh is king; he clothes himself with majesty.
    Yahweh clothes himself; he girds himself with might.
    Yes, the world is established so that it will not be moved.
    2 Your throne is established from of old;
    you are from everlasting.
    3 The rivers have lifted up, O Yahweh;
    the rivers have lifted up their ⌊rumbling⌋;
    the rivers have lifted up their pounding.
    4 Mightier than the rumblings of many waters,
    mightier than the mighty breakers of the sea,
    Yahweh on high is mighty.
    5 Your testimonies are fully reliable.
    Holiness is fitting for your house,
    O Yahweh, ⌊forever⌋.

## Observations

- Yahweh is king; **he clothes himself** with majesty. **Yahweh clothes
  himself**; he girds himself with might.

  - It seems relevant to focus on Yahweh, the king, clothing himself. He has
    partners, humans, and ceremonial guardians in the spiritual realm (cherubim,
    seraphim, etc) and yet he clothes himself. His court doesn't clothe him - they
    praise him certainly, but no one puts on Yahweh's kingly attire besides
    Yahweh himself

- You are everlasting
  - In my post [[by-gods-grace]] I note that Yahweh owns us and everything. He
    is the ruler of the universe because he is everlasting... no beginning and no
    end

## Reflection

[[by-gods-grace]] the words "Yahweh is king" are a comfort to me. I am a
wretch, but a wretch Yahweh is working on, has grace with, and ultimately
invites into paradise... Paradise in that he invites me to be a complete human,
to fulfil purpose I was designed for. By God's grace, he is king and he's given
me a will that seeks to align with his... Amen
