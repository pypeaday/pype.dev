content: "!!! note \"Deuteronomy 29:29\"\n\n    The hidden things belong to Yahweh
  our God, but the revealed things belong to us to know and to our children forever,
  in order to do all the words of this law.\n\nHere is a truth every Christian should
  meditate on and remember whenever they\nfind themselves so sure of a biblical teaching.
  There are things not meant for\nus to know - not that we cannot enjoy the musings,
  but we need to rightly\nunderstand that there are mechanisms in the world that are
  only known to\nYahweh. Just like my daughters have no actual understanding of how
  they became\nmy daughters, or how money shows up in our account every month, or
  how water\ncomes to our house... These things are beyond their scope of existence
  to be\nhonest, and there are analogous things that we fully-grown mature adults
  need\nto recognize are beyond us and are for the Lord, only.\n\nThis is not an excuse
  or encouragement though to never be sure of a\nconviction... there most certainly
  are \"revealed things \\[that\\] belong to us\nto know\". So the Christian needs
  to graciously approach the things we can't run\naway from, but also recognize that
  our understanding is, by nature of our\nexistence, limited.\n\nThe truth a lot of
  us wrestle with, and probably not very well, is\n**Soteriology** - the theology
  of salvation. There are a number of things that\ngo into the mechanism of receiving
  salvation from the Lord: a regenerated\nheart, faith in Jesus alone, confession,
  and the process of becomming more like\nJesus (sanctification). However, the **order
  by which** these things happen has\nbeen a long-debated issue in the Church and
  has led to a lot of\nChristian-division.\n\nI'm not going to claim to understnad
  the [orto salutis] but what I can do is\nrecognize a reality in my life, perhaps
  even somewhat contradictory realties,\nand given that objective truth of those realities
  I'll have to eventually\nrecognize that the intimate understanding and knowledge
  of the inner-workings\nof those realities is hidden from me.\n\nIt goes like this
  - no one can choose Yahweh on their own. We are born into death and decay:\n\n!!!
  note \"Ephesians 2:1\"\n\n    And you, although you were dead in your trespasses
  and sins,\n\n!!! note \"Romans 3:23\"\n\n    for all have sinned and fall short
  of the glory of God,\n\nSo inconvenient truth number 1: you are dead, dead people
  can't make choices or\ndo anything... but surely \"dead in your tresspasses\" and
  \"fall short of the\nglory of God\" are just indicators that we can't live a perfectly
  \"good\" life...\nno?\n\nWell, it won't really matter and here's why:\n\n!!! note
  \"John 14:6\"\n\n    Jesus said to him, \u201CI am the way, and the truth, and the
  life. No one comes to the Father except through me.\n\nSo here's the thing - either
  Jesus is the son of God or he isn't... Simple\nbinary truth. If he's **not** the
  son of God, then half of this blog is\nworthless and Paul's words that Christians
  should lbe pitied above all people\nwould never be more true... But if Jesus **is
  the son of God** and his words\n**are actual truth** then you really need to wrestle
  with it, if only for a\nsecond... He's either a crazy liar, or literally God. This
  truth, or the option\nof which of these things are true, are 100% unavoidable for
  every person to\ndeal with. Like, you have to make a choice - either accept what
  Jesus says, or\ndon't.\n\nBut that actually brings up the tension - you can't accept
  it unless Yahweh\ngives you over to Jesus.\n\n!!! note \"John 6:37\u201340\"\n\n
  \   Everyone whom the Father gives to me will come to me, and the one who comes\n
  \   to me I will never throw out, 38\_because I have come down from heaven not that\n
  \   I should do my will, but the will of the one who sent me. 39\_Now this is the\n
  \   will of the one who sent me: that everyone whom he has given me, I would not\n
  \   lose any of them, but raise them up on the last day. 40\_For this is the will
  of\n    my Father, that everyone who looks at the Son and believes in him would
  have\n    eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.\u201D\n\nSo...
  is the one born destined to not believe simply destined for hell? What\nkind of
  loving God is that?\n\nThe answer there is actually pretty simple - he's a loving
  father. I wrote a\nlittle bit about this via analogies to my own life as a parent
  in\n[[advent-2025---love]]. Essentially as a dad, I take my own kids home from the\nplayground
  every day, not your kids. Likewise, God will redeem his own... It's\nliterally a
  perfectly reasonable expectation of a dad.\n\n## Hidden vs. Revealed\n\nWhat is
  for us and what is for God alone then (as we discuss Soteriology)? A\nlot. And in
  this case I'm not even sure where to draw the line but here is a\nsimple list of
  truths that **are true** even though I couldn't explain with\nevery nuance - how?\n\n1.
  I hated God - every unregenerate person does, it is **only natural** to hate\n   what
  you're opposed to. Being born into sin and death necessarily means you\n   are are
  opposed to life and godliness.\n2. I now love God - my personal story here is a
  picture of God's providence -\n   see [[helkyo-what-is-it-for-god-to-draw-man-to-him]]\n3.
  Yahweh desires for all people to be reconciled (1 Peter)\n4. Not everyone believes
  in Jesus - which means there are people destined for\n   hell\n\nHere's what I think
  is hidden...\n\n1. The reasons which God chooses some and not others - thank the
  Lord this is\n   not for me to know\n2. The mechanism by which my heart is able
  to make a **free** choice, out of my\n   own agency, not to initially believe in
  Jesus, but every day to lay my life\n   down before him (as I do or do not live
  faithfully to him)\n3. What reality of \"hell\" there is to be predestined to...
  I cannot deny at all\n   that not all people are chosen by God, not all people will
  enter the\n   Celestial City... But what of the others? I genuinely do not know,
  but I have a\n   lot of confidence that the fire and torture crowd are missing some
  stuff.\n\n## Fin\n\nPraise the Lord that there are things beyond us to know... It
  is comforting to\nknow that Jesus loves me, and I don't need to know much more beyond
  that. Just\nlike one of my biggest desires is for my daughters to trust me because
  of my\nlove for them, in the same way is how I find and am comforted by the Lord.
  If\nyou're reading this and haven't heard him call your name, maybe sit and listen.\nWhen
  Jesus called Lazarus from the grave, he might've had the choice whether to\nwalk
  out or not, but he didn't have the choice to not wake-up. If the Lord\nawakens your
  heart today, may you make the choice to walk out of the grave and\ninto new life."

    29:29</p>\n<p>The hidden things belong to Yahweh our God, but the revealed things
    belong to us to know and to our children forever, in order to do all the words
    of this law.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Here is a truth every Christian should meditate on
    and remember whenever they\nfind themselves so sure of a biblical teaching. There
    are things not meant for\nus to know - not that we cannot enjoy the musings, but
    we need to rightly\nunderstand that there are mechanisms in the world that are
    only known to\nYahweh. Just like my daughters have no actual understanding of
    how they became\nmy daughters, or how money shows up in our account every month,
    or how water\ncomes to our house... These things are beyond their scope of existence
    to be\nhonest, and there are analogous things that we fully-grown mature adults
    need\nto recognize are beyond us and are for the Lord, only.</p>\n<p>This is not
    an excuse or encouragement though to never be sure of a\nconviction... there most
    certainly are &quot;revealed things [that] belong to us\nto know&quot;. So the
    Christian needs to graciously approach the things we can't run\naway from, but
    also recognize that our understanding is, by nature of our\nexistence, limited.</p>\n<p>The
    truth a lot of us wrestle with, and probably not very well, is\n<strong>Soteriology</strong>
    - the theology of salvation. There are a number of things that\ngo into the mechanism
    of receiving salvation from the Lord: a regenerated\nheart, faith in Jesus alone,
    confession, and the process of becomming more like\nJesus (sanctification). However,
    the <strong>order by which</strong> these things happen has\nbeen a long-debated
    issue in the Church and has led to a lot of\nChristian-division.</p>\n<p>I'm not
    going to claim to understnad the [orto salutis] but what I can do is\nrecognize
    a reality in my life, perhaps even somewhat contradictory realties,\nand given
    that objective truth of those realities I'll have to eventually\nrecognize that
    the intimate understanding and knowledge of the inner-workings\nof those realities
    is hidden from me.</p>\n<p>It goes like this - no one can choose Yahweh on their
    own. We are born into death and decay:</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Ephesians 2:1</p>\n<p>And you, although you were dead
    in your trespasses and sins,</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Romans 3:23</p>\n<p>for all have sinned and fall short
    of the glory of God,</p>\n</div>\n<p>So inconvenient truth number 1: you are dead,
    dead people can't make choices or\ndo anything... but surely &quot;dead in your
    tresspasses&quot; and &quot;fall short of the\nglory of God&quot; are just indicators
    that we can't live a perfectly &quot;good&quot; life...\nno?</p>\n<p>Well, it
    won't really matter and here's why:</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">John
    14:6</p>\n<p>Jesus said to him, \u201CI am the way, and the truth, and the life.
    No one comes to the Father except through me.</p>\n</div>\n<p>So here's the thing
    - either Jesus is the son of God or he isn't... Simple\nbinary truth. If he's
    <strong>not</strong> the son of God, then half of this blog is\nworthless and
    Paul's words that Christians should lbe pitied above all people\nwould never be
    more true... But if Jesus <strong>is the son of God</strong> and his words\n<strong>are
    actual truth</strong> then you really need to wrestle with it, if only for a\nsecond...
    He's either a crazy liar, or literally God. This truth, or the option\nof which
    of these things are true, are 100% unavoidable for every person to\ndeal with.
    Like, you have to make a choice - either accept what Jesus says, or\ndon't.</p>\n<p>But
    that actually brings up the tension - you can't accept it unless Yahweh\ngives
    you over to Jesus.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">John
    6:37\u201340</p>\n<p>Everyone whom the Father gives to me will come to me, and
    the one who comes\nto me I will never throw out, 38\_because I have come down
    from heaven not that\nI should do my will, but the will of the one who sent me.
    39\_Now this is the\nwill of the one who sent me: that everyone whom he has given
    me, I would not\nlose any of them, but raise them up on the last day. 40\_For
    this is the will of\nmy Father, that everyone who looks at the Son and believes
    in him would have\neternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.\u201D</p>\n</div>\n<p>So...
    is the one born destined to not believe simply destined for hell? What\nkind of
    loving God is that?</p>\n<p>The answer there is actually pretty simple - he's
    a loving father. I wrote a\nlittle bit about this via analogies to my own life
    as a parent in\n<a class=\"wikilink\" href=\"/advent-2025---love\">advent-2025---love</a>.
    Essentially as a dad, I take my own kids home from the\nplayground every day,
    not your kids. Likewise, God will redeem his own... It's\nliterally a perfectly
    reasonable expectation of a dad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hidden-vs-revealed\">Hidden vs.

    is for God alone then (as we discuss Soteriology)? A\nlot. And in this case I'm
    not even sure where to draw the line but here is a\nsimple list of truths that
    <strong>are true</strong> even though I couldn't explain with\nevery nuance -
    how?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I hated God - every unregenerate person does, it is <strong>only
    natural</strong> to hate\nwhat you're opposed to. Being born into sin and death
    necessarily means you\nare are opposed to life and godliness.</li>\n<li>I now
    love God - my personal story here is a picture of God's providence -\nsee <a class=\"wikilink\"
    href=\"/helkyo-what-is-it-for-god-to-draw-man-to-him\">helkyo-what-is-it-for-god-to-draw-man-to-him</a></li>\n<li>Yahweh
    desires for all people to be reconciled (1 Peter)</li>\n<li>Not everyone believes
    in Jesus - which means there are people destined for\nhell</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here's
    what I think is hidden...</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The reasons which God chooses some and
    not others - thank the Lord this is\nnot for me to know</li>\n<li>The mechanism
    by which my heart is able to make a <strong>free</strong> choice, out of my\nown
    agency, not to initially believe in Jesus, but every day to lay my life\ndown
    before him (as I do or do not live faithfully to him)</li>\n<li>What reality of
    &quot;hell&quot; there is to be predestined to... I cannot deny at all\nthat not
    all people are chosen by God, not all people will enter the\nCelestial City...
    But what of the others? I genuinely do not know, but I have a\nlot of confidence
    that the fire and torture crowd are missing some stuff.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"fin\">Fin

    there are things beyond us to know... It is comforting to\nknow that Jesus loves
    me, and I don't need to know much more beyond that. Just\nlike one of my biggest
    desires is for my daughters to trust me because of my\nlove for them, in the same
    way is how I find and am comforted by the Lord. If\nyou're reading this and haven't
    heard him call your name, maybe sit and listen.\nWhen Jesus called Lazarus from
    the grave, he might've had the choice whether to\nwalk out or not, but he didn't
    have the choice to not wake-up. If the Lord\nawakens your heart today, may you

    29:29</p>\n<p>The hidden things belong to Yahweh our God, but the revealed things
    belong to us to know and to our children forever, in order to do all the words
    of this law.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Here is a truth every Christian should meditate on
    and remember whenever they\nfind themselves so sure of a biblical teaching. There
    are things not meant for\nus to know - not that we cannot enjoy the musings, but
    we need to rightly\nunderstand that there are mechanisms in the world that are
    only known to\nYahweh. Just like my daughters have no actual understanding of
    how they became\nmy daughters, or how money shows up in our account every month,
    or how water\ncomes to our house... These things are beyond their scope of existence
    to be\nhonest, and there are analogous things that we fully-grown mature adults
    need\nto recognize are beyond us and are for the Lord, only.</p>\n<p>This is not
    an excuse or encouragement though to never be sure of a\nconviction... there most
    certainly are &quot;revealed things [that] belong to us\nto know&quot;. So the
    Christian needs to graciously approach the things we can't run\naway from, but
    also recognize that our understanding is, by nature of our\nexistence, limited.</p>\n<p>The
    truth a lot of us wrestle with, and probably not very well, is\n<strong>Soteriology</strong>
    - the theology of salvation. There are a number of things that\ngo into the mechanism
    of receiving salvation from the Lord: a regenerated\nheart, faith in Jesus alone,
    confession, and the process of becomming more like\nJesus (sanctification). However,
    the <strong>order by which</strong> these things happen has\nbeen a long-debated
    issue in the Church and has led to a lot of\nChristian-division.</p>\n<p>I'm not
    going to claim to understnad the [orto salutis] but what I can do is\nrecognize
    a reality in my life, perhaps even somewhat contradictory realties,\nand given
    that objective truth of those realities I'll have to eventually\nrecognize that
    the intimate understanding and knowledge of the inner-workings\nof those realities
    is hidden from me.</p>\n<p>It goes like this - no one can choose Yahweh on their
    own. We are born into death and decay:</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Ephesians 2:1</p>\n<p>And you, although you were dead
    in your trespasses and sins,</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Romans 3:23</p>\n<p>for all have sinned and fall short
    of the glory of God,</p>\n</div>\n<p>So inconvenient truth number 1: you are dead,
    dead people can't make choices or\ndo anything... but surely &quot;dead in your
    tresspasses&quot; and &quot;fall short of the\nglory of God&quot; are just indicators
    that we can't live a perfectly &quot;good&quot; life...\nno?</p>\n<p>Well, it
    won't really matter and here's why:</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">John
    14:6</p>\n<p>Jesus said to him, \u201CI am the way, and the truth, and the life.
    No one comes to the Father except through me.</p>\n</div>\n<p>So here's the thing
    - either Jesus is the son of God or he isn't... Simple\nbinary truth. If he's
    <strong>not</strong> the son of God, then half of this blog is\nworthless and
    Paul's words that Christians should lbe pitied above all people\nwould never be
    more true... But if Jesus <strong>is the son of God</strong> and his words\n<strong>are
    actual truth</strong> then you really need to wrestle with it, if only for a\nsecond...
    He's either a crazy liar, or literally God. This truth, or the option\nof which
    of these things are true, are 100% unavoidable for every person to\ndeal with.
    Like, you have to make a choice - either accept what Jesus says, or\ndon't.</p>\n<p>But
    that actually brings up the tension - you can't accept it unless Yahweh\ngives
    you over to Jesus.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">John
    6:37\u201340</p>\n<p>Everyone whom the Father gives to me will come to me, and
    the one who comes\nto me I will never throw out, 38\_because I have come down
    from heaven not that\nI should do my will, but the will of the one who sent me.
    39\_Now this is the\nwill of the one who sent me: that everyone whom he has given
    me, I would not\nlose any of them, but raise them up on the last day. 40\_For
    this is the will of\nmy Father, that everyone who looks at the Son and believes
    in him would have\neternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.\u201D</p>\n</div>\n<p>So...
    is the one born destined to not believe simply destined for hell? What\nkind of
    loving God is that?</p>\n<p>The answer there is actually pretty simple - he's
    a loving father. I wrote a\nlittle bit about this via analogies to my own life
    as a parent in\n<a class=\"wikilink\" href=\"/advent-2025---love\">advent-2025---love</a>.
    Essentially as a dad, I take my own kids home from the\nplayground every day,
    not your kids. Likewise, God will redeem his own... It's\nliterally a perfectly
    reasonable expectation of a dad.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hidden-vs-revealed\">Hidden vs.

    is for God alone then (as we discuss Soteriology)? A\nlot. And in this case I'm
    not even sure where to draw the line but here is a\nsimple list of truths that
    <strong>are true</strong> even though I couldn't explain with\nevery nuance -
    how?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I hated God - every unregenerate person does, it is <strong>only
    natural</strong> to hate\nwhat you're opposed to. Being born into sin and death
    necessarily means you\nare are opposed to life and godliness.</li>\n<li>I now
    love God - my personal story here is a picture of God's providence -\nsee <a class=\"wikilink\"

    desires for all people to be reconciled (1 Peter)</li>\n<li>Not everyone believes
    in Jesus - which means there are people destined for\nhell</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here's
    what I think is hidden...</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The reasons which God chooses some and
    not others - thank the Lord this is\nnot for me to know</li>\n<li>The mechanism
    by which my heart is able to make a <strong>free</strong> choice, out of my\nown
    agency, not to initially believe in Jesus, but every day to lay my life\ndown
    before him (as I do or do not live faithfully to him)</li>\n<li>What reality of
    &quot;hell&quot; there is to be predestined to... I cannot deny at all\nthat not
    all people are chosen by God, not all people will enter the\nCelestial City...
    But what of the others? I genuinely do not know, but I have a\nlot of confidence
    that the fire and torture crowd are missing some stuff.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"fin\">Fin

    note \"Deuteronomy 29:29\"\n\n    The hidden things belong to Yahweh our God,
    but the revealed things belong to us to know and to our children forever, in order
    to do all the words of this law.\n\nHere is a truth every Christian should meditate
    on and remember whenever they\nfind themselves so sure of a biblical teaching.
    There are things not meant for\nus to know - not that we cannot enjoy the musings,
    but we need to rightly\nunderstand that there are mechanisms in the world that
    are only known to\nYahweh. Just like my daughters have no actual understanding
    of how they became\nmy daughters, or how money shows up in our account every month,
    or how water\ncomes to our house... These things are beyond their scope of existence
    to be\nhonest, and there are analogous things that we fully-grown mature adults
    need\nto recognize are beyond us and are for the Lord, only.\n\nThis is not an
    excuse or encouragement though to never be sure of a\nconviction... there most
    certainly are \"revealed things \\[that\\] belong to us\nto know\". So the Christian
    needs to graciously approach the things we can't run\naway from, but also recognize
    that our understanding is, by nature of our\nexistence, limited.\n\nThe truth
    a lot of us wrestle with, and probably not very well, is\n**Soteriology** - the
    theology of salvation. There are a number of things that\ngo into the mechanism
    of receiving salvation from the Lord: a regenerated\nheart, faith in Jesus alone,
    confession, and the process of becomming more like\nJesus (sanctification). However,
    the **order by which** these things happen has\nbeen a long-debated issue in the
    Church and has led to a lot of\nChristian-division.\n\nI'm not going to claim
    to understnad the [orto salutis] but what I can do is\nrecognize a reality in
    my life, perhaps even somewhat contradictory realties,\nand given that objective
    truth of those realities I'll have to eventually\nrecognize that the intimate
    understanding and knowledge of the inner-workings\nof those realities is hidden
    from me.\n\nIt goes like this - no one can choose Yahweh on their own. We are
    born into death and decay:\n\n!!! note \"Ephesians 2:1\"\n\n    And you, although
    you were dead in your trespasses and sins,\n\n!!! note \"Romans 3:23\"\n\n    for
    all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,\n\nSo inconvenient truth number
    1: you are dead, dead people can't make choices or\ndo anything... but surely
    \"dead in your tresspasses\" and \"fall short of the\nglory of God\" are just
    indicators that we can't live a perfectly \"good\" life...\nno?\n\nWell, it won't

title: The Hidden Things Belong To Yahweh


---

!!! note "Deuteronomy 29:29"

    The hidden things belong to Yahweh our God, but the revealed things belong to us to know and to our children forever, in order to do all the words of this law.

Here is a truth every Christian should meditate on and remember whenever they
find themselves so sure of a biblical teaching. There are things not meant for
us to know - not that we cannot enjoy the musings, but we need to rightly
understand that there are mechanisms in the world that are only known to
Yahweh. Just like my daughters have no actual understanding of how they became
my daughters, or how money shows up in our account every month, or how water
comes to our house... These things are beyond their scope of existence to be
honest, and there are analogous things that we fully-grown mature adults need
to recognize are beyond us and are for the Lord, only.

This is not an excuse or encouragement though to never be sure of a
conviction... there most certainly are "revealed things \[that\] belong to us
to know". So the Christian needs to graciously approach the things we can't run
away from, but also recognize that our understanding is, by nature of our
existence, limited.

The truth a lot of us wrestle with, and probably not very well, is
**Soteriology** - the theology of salvation. There are a number of things that
go into the mechanism of receiving salvation from the Lord: a regenerated
heart, faith in Jesus alone, confession, and the process of becomming more like
Jesus (sanctification). However, the **order by which** these things happen has
been a long-debated issue in the Church and has led to a lot of
Christian-division.

I'm not going to claim to understnad the [orto salutis] but what I can do is
recognize a reality in my life, perhaps even somewhat contradictory realties,
and given that objective truth of those realities I'll have to eventually
recognize that the intimate understanding and knowledge of the inner-workings
of those realities is hidden from me.

It goes like this - no one can choose Yahweh on their own. We are born into death and decay:

!!! note "Ephesians 2:1"

    And you, although you were dead in your trespasses and sins,

!!! note "Romans 3:23"

    for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,

So inconvenient truth number 1: you are dead, dead people can't make choices or
do anything... but surely "dead in your tresspasses" and "fall short of the
glory of God" are just indicators that we can't live a perfectly "good" life...
no?

Well, it won't really matter and here's why:

!!! note "John 14:6"

    Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

So here's the thing - either Jesus is the son of God or he isn't... Simple
binary truth. If he's **not** the son of God, then half of this blog is
worthless and Paul's words that Christians should lbe pitied above all people
would never be more true... But if Jesus **is the son of God** and his words
**are actual truth** then you really need to wrestle with it, if only for a
second... He's either a crazy liar, or literally God. This truth, or the option
of which of these things are true, are 100% unavoidable for every person to
deal with. Like, you have to make a choice - either accept what Jesus says, or
don't.

But that actually brings up the tension - you can't accept it unless Yahweh
gives you over to Jesus.

!!! note "John 6:37–40"

    Everyone whom the Father gives to me will come to me, and the one who comes
    to me I will never throw out, 38 because I have come down from heaven not that
    I should do my will, but the will of the one who sent me. 39 Now this is the
    will of the one who sent me: that everyone whom he has given me, I would not
    lose any of them, but raise them up on the last day. 40 For this is the will of
    my Father, that everyone who looks at the Son and believes in him would have
    eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”

So... is the one born destined to not believe simply destined for hell? What
kind of loving God is that?

The answer there is actually pretty simple - he's a loving father. I wrote a
little bit about this via analogies to my own life as a parent in
[[advent-2025---love]]. Essentially as a dad, I take my own kids home from the
playground every day, not your kids. Likewise, God will redeem his own... It's
literally a perfectly reasonable expectation of a dad.

## Hidden vs. Revealed

What is for us and what is for God alone then (as we discuss Soteriology)? A
lot. And in this case I'm not even sure where to draw the line but here is a
simple list of truths that **are true** even though I couldn't explain with
every nuance - how?

1. I hated God - every unregenerate person does, it is **only natural** to hate
   what you're opposed to. Being born into sin and death necessarily means you
   are are opposed to life and godliness.
2. I now love God - my personal story here is a picture of God's providence -
   see [[helkyo-what-is-it-for-god-to-draw-man-to-him]]
3. Yahweh desires for all people to be reconciled (1 Peter)
4. Not everyone believes in Jesus - which means there are people destined for
   hell

Here's what I think is hidden...

1. The reasons which God chooses some and not others - thank the Lord this is
   not for me to know
2. The mechanism by which my heart is able to make a **free** choice, out of my
   own agency, not to initially believe in Jesus, but every day to lay my life
   down before him (as I do or do not live faithfully to him)
3. What reality of "hell" there is to be predestined to... I cannot deny at all
   that not all people are chosen by God, not all people will enter the
   Celestial City... But what of the others? I genuinely do not know, but I have a
   lot of confidence that the fire and torture crowd are missing some stuff.

## Fin

Praise the Lord that there are things beyond us to know... It is comforting to
know that Jesus loves me, and I don't need to know much more beyond that. Just
like one of my biggest desires is for my daughters to trust me because of my
love for them, in the same way is how I find and am comforted by the Lord. If
you're reading this and haven't heard him call your name, maybe sit and listen.
When Jesus called Lazarus from the grave, he might've had the choice whether to

awakens your heart today, may you make the choice to walk out of the grave and
into new life.
