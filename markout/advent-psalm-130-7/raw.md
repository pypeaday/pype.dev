!!! note "Psalm 130:7"

    O Israel, wait for Yahweh.  For with Yahweh there is loyal love,  and with him there is abundant redemption.

## He-sed

Yahweh's `loyal love` is `חֶ֫סֶד` (he-sed)... It comes from Exodus 34

!!! note "Exodus 34:6-7"

    6 And Yahweh passed over before him, and he proclaimed, “Yahweh, Yahweh, God, who is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding with loyal love and faithfulness, 7 keeping loyal love to the thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and he does not leave utterly unpunished, punishing the guilt of fathers on sons and on sons of sons on third and fourth generations.”

`abounding with loyal love and faithfulness`

`hesed` love is undying, unending, enduring, and everlasting. Yahweh's love for
his people isn't a function of their love or loyalty to him - he is loyal to
himself and in that loyalty he is faithful to me

God's abundant redemption, as an artifact of his hesed love for me, is my daily
bread. Every morning, with various amount of devotion, do I sit down and
reflect on Jesus's goodness to me... Of course I pray the blessings don't stop,
but the blessings are not his love and redemption, they certainly are favor,
but Jesus' love runs deeper than a house and steady income.

In his loyal love Jesus saves
