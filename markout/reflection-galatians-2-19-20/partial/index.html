<p class="admonition-title">Galatians 2:19-20</p>
<p>19 For through the law I died to the law, in order that I might live to
God. I have been crucified with Christ, 20 and I no longer live, but Christ
lives in me, and that life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son
of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.</p>

<p>This is one of the most common verse-memory verses I think. Probably there's
good reason for that - Paul has a lot to say to the Galatians, and these 2
verses summarize one of the simple truths of the Gospel - the life a Christian
is given is <strong>freed from</strong> the law of death and make alive to Jesus. The gospel
truth is that the law is no longer the thing we answer to - everyone will,
certainly. There's no mistake to be made that every human has accountability
for their own agency. In our &quot;free&quot; will, bound to sin and death and to the law
for approval, we aren't free at all but slaves to an oppressive overlord. Jesus
frees the Christian to live a life free from that oppression, in the
life-giving security of God's adoption.</p>

<p>God adopts whoever he chooses. And the ones he chooses are then freely able to
choose him in return. Through the life-giving power of God's sovereignty my
life can be fundamentally altered, my make-up changed, my family line updated.
I am free to live my life by faith in Jesus, because he loved me and gave
himself for me.</p>
