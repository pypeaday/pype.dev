Spurgeon's **Morning and Evening** reflection for this morning is Micah 2:10 "Arise, and depart".

!!! note "context"

    Typical note about reflections not being deep study. Also noting that Spurgeon's meditations are often about what comes to mind from the words of a verse (or part of it) as opposed to the context of the verse.

!!! note "Micah 2:10"

    Arise and go,  for this is no resting place,  on account of uncleanness that destroys  with painful destruction.

So the context of the rest of the verse isn't that consistent with the
direction of Spurgon's meditation but nonetheless his springboard is good to
think about...

Someday everyone of us will answer the call to "arise and go" - death comes for
us all but death isn't itself an existential end, it is the time to obey the
Lord. At his word, I will leave the world and go to where he calls me. This is
true for everyone, it's an inescapable part of the reality that Yahweh has
created for all Creation.

Death fills some with dread, but for the Christian it's the passage to
eternity. We live (or "are to live") in Heaven today - Jesus brought Heaven to
earth. But his life, death, and resurrection did not **fully** bring Heaven to
earth - the melding is happening, the reunification of Heaven and earth as it
was in Eden is taking place, and when he comes again the kingdom will be
consummated.

So we live unto his Name and glory, because it's the best thing
for humanity. And at the end of our living on this present earth, God calls
everyone to the next phase of reality. What awaits those who do not believe?
and who haven't been chosen? I really wouldn't claim to know concrete facts
beyond the truth that "they are not citizens of heaven, and so they do not live with
the Lord". But what awaits the Christian? That's a much easier answer to take a
stand on - those loved by Jesus are not left dead in the cold dark underground,
we are called to the skies - to glory and to the kingdom.

I think this thought of future unification with the Lord, in a newly
consummated kingdom, when Death is dead and there is no more competition
amongst the gods, when all Creation is in right relationship with the King -
this thought should bring joy and anticipation to the Christian, to me.

Let me work for the glory of God today, with the right perspective that at any
moment I could be called away from this work (my family, my home, my job, etc.)
and to the next thing Jesus would have me do. I look forward to the call to
"Arise and go" and I pray that the future hope of the Kingdom fills me today
with joy and motivation to live a godly life and that death never looks like
anything other than a river to cross with new life on the other side.
