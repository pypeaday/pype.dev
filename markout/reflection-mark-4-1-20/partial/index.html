<p>I am in the middle of reprocessing the soils' parable - I heard a very
interesting interpretation the other day that I'm following up on. BUt while I
wait for clarity in that conversation, there is still obvious truth for me to
reflect on this morning...</p>
<div class="admonition note is-collapsible collapsible-open">
<p class="admonition-title">Mark 4:1-20</p>
<p>Mark 4:1–20 (LEB):  4And again he began to teach beside the sea, and a very large crowd was gathered to him, so that he got into a boat and sat on the sea, and the whole crowd was at the sea on the land. 2 And he began to teach them many things in parables, and was saying to them in his teaching, 3 “Listen! Behold, the sower went out to sow. 4 And it happened that while he was sowing, some seed fell on the side of the path, and the birds came and devoured it. 5 And other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up at once, because it did not have any depth of soil. 6 And when the sun rose it was scorched, and because it did not have enough root, it withered. 7 And other seed fell among the thorn plants, and the thorn plants came up and choked it, and it did not produce grain. 8 And other seed fell on the good soil, and produced grain, coming up and increasing, and it bore a crop—one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred times as much. 9 And he said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear!”   10 And when he was alone, those around him together with the twelve began asking him about the parables. 11 And he said to them, “To you has been granted the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside everything is in parables, 12 so that  ‘they may look closely and not perceive,  and they may listen carefully and not understand,  lest they turn and it be forgiven them.’ ”   13 And he said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? And how will you understand all the parables? 14 The sower sows the word. 15 And these are the ones beside the path where the word is sown, and whenever they hear it, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. 16 And these are like the ones sown on the rocky ground, who whenever they hear the word immediately receive it with joy. 17 And they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Then when affliction or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they fall away. 18 And others are the ones sown among the thorn plants—these are the ones who hear the word, 19 and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word and it becomes unproductive. 20 And those are the ones sown on the good soil, who hear the word and receive it and bear fruit—one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred times as much.”</p>

<p>By God's good grace on my life, the Word has been sown and without a doubt my
faith has been proven beyond the depths of the path and shallow soils. My life
has not been without testing (not that I would ever claim to have not been
given a better life than 99% of humans in the history of the world), but I fear
the test of my heart as it pertains to the thorny soil. God has been very good
to me in work and finances. We aren't ultra-wealthy, but I do have more than I
need. And something I notice... as I've earned more, and invested more, I care
more... My thoughts often wander around from &quot;I should read that Proverb&quot; to
&quot;If I can save X more dollars I could retire N weeks sooner&quot;. I think what I
desire is freedom from the corporate cycle in America, but I fear what I desire
is the comfort to give into my own whims without having to show up to a job
tomorrow.</p>
<p>I do not think financial independence is a sin, or the desire of it. But I
think it does take a special constitution, a unique gifting from God, to
steward riches appropriately in a broken world while submitting oneself to the
kingship of Jesus. I have known several wealthy Christians - they're hard
workers and in general I think they're honoring God with their work... but do
I? And in the working, whether honoring or not in the manner that I <em>do</em> it, am I
honoring God in the manner in which I <em>think</em> about it? I don't know... I
honestly can only say with 100% certainty that I'm thankful God knows my heart
better than I do, and I pray he helps my unbelief and quenches the underlying
fears and anxieties about the riches of this life and what those riches enable.</p>
