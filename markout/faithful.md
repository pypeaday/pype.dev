  Exodusds 34:6\n\n    Compassioante and gracious, slow to anger, overflowing with
  loyal love and faithfulness\n\nFaithfulness - Emet (can be translated 'Truth')\nRelated
  to \"Amen\" which is untranslated Hebrew expression meaning \"that's truth\"\n\n##
  Stability\n\nMoses has to hold his hands up when Israel faces the Amalekites. Joshua
  (and another) bring Moses a rock to sit on and hold is hands up so they could be
  Emet.\n\n## People\n\nDescribs trustiworthiness \n\nExodus 18:21 - Moses apoints
  leaders are to be \"Emet\"\n\n## God and promises\n\nGod is a rock - he is faithful,
  just, and upright\n\nHebrew word for trust is He'Emin which is the verb form of
  Emet\n\nAbraham considers God Emet, he He'Emin's God and God blesses this by creating
  Isreal.\n\nIsrael, In Exodus 14:31, He'Emin's God (until they see the gians in Canaan
  that is)\n\n1 Kings 1:6 says David walked in Emet with God\n\n2 Samuel 7:16, God
  blesses David and says his kingdom will have Emet\n\nRomans 15:8-9 says Jesus came
  on behalf of God's faithfulness.\n\n# Questions\n\n!!! note \"1\"\n\n    The Hebrew
  word \u201Cemet\u201D is translated with words like \u201Cfaithful,\u201D\n    \u201Creliable,\u201D
  \u201Csure,\u201D \u201Ctrustworthy,\u201D and \u201Camen.\u201D Read aloud Psalm
  36:5-6 ,\n    Psalm 19:7 , and Psalm 41:13 and discuss what the psalmists are\n
  \   communicating in these passages when they use the word \u201Cemet.\u201D\n\n!!!
  scripture \"Psalms 36:5-6\"\n\n    5Your lovingkindness, O Lord, extends to the
  heavens,\n\n    Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.\n\n    6Your righteousness
  is like the mountains of God;\n\n    Your judgments are like a great deep.\n\n    O
  Lord, You preserve man and beast.\n\n\n!!! scripture \"Psalms 19:7\"\n\n    7The
  law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul;\n\n    The testimony of the Lord
  is sure, making wise the simple.\n\n\n!!! scripture \"Psalms 41:13\"\n\n\n    13Blessed
  be the Lord, the God of Israel,\n\n    From everlasting to everlasting.\n\n    Amen
  and Amen.\n\n\nI think the lesson here is pretty simple - God is faithful, full
  stop. His\nfaithfulness doesn't look necessarily like how we might want... when
  I was a\nkid I would be upset if my parents didn't respond to me in the way I wanted,\nand
  my kids will certainly share that disappointment. But I am faithful to my\nchildren
  - sometimes the main issue is a child's outlook on a situation or\nworldview. I
  think that metaphor holds true in relation to humans and Yahweh -\nhe sees the whole
  world, we see a part of it so we cannot understand\nfaithfulness fully, in the same
  way that my children can't understand my\nfaithfulness to them fully - even to the
  point of being upset or thinking that\n_I'm not being faithful_\n\n!!! note \"2\"\n\n
  \   God promised the Israelites that he would give them a king of peace that\n    would
  rule forever and ever (e.g. 2 Samuel 7:16). However, Israel\u2019s kingdom\n    collapsed
  and they found themselves without a home or a king. Compare the\n    beginning of
  Psalm 89 (vv. 1-10) with the way it closes (vv. 46-52). What\n    do you think it
  practically looks like to trust God when all seems lost?\n\n!!! scripture \"2 Samuel
  7:16\"\n\n    16Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your
  throne shall be established forever.\u201D\u2009\u2019\u2009\u201D\n\n!!! scripture
  \"PSALM 89\"\n\n    The Lord\u2019s Covenant with David, and Israel\u2019s Afflictions.\n\n
  \   A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.\n\n    1I will sing of the lovingkindness of
  the Lord forever;\n\n    To all generations I will make known Your faithfulness
  with my mouth.\n\n    2For I have said, \u201CLovingkindness will be built up forever;\n\n
  \   In the heavens You will establish Your faithfulness.\u201D\n\n    3\u201CI have
  made a covenant with My chosen;\n\n    I have sworn to David My servant,\n\n    4I
  will establish your seed forever\n\n    And build up your throne to all generations.\u201D
  Selah.\n\n    5The heavens will praise Your wonders, O Lord;\n\n    Your faithfulness
  also in the assembly of the holy ones.\n\n    6For who in the skies is comparable
  to the Lord?\n\n    Who among the sons of the mighty is like the Lord,\n\n    7A
  God greatly feared in the council of the holy ones,\n\n    And awesome above all
  those who are around Him?\n\n    8O Lord God of hosts, who is like You, O mighty
  Lord?\n\n    Your faithfulness also surrounds You.\n\n    9You rule the swelling
  of the sea;\n\n\n!!! note \"3\"\n\n    Ultimately, God answers the psalmist\u2019s
  cries in the person of Jesus. Compare 2 Samuel 7:16\n    2 Samuel 7:16\n\n    16Your
  house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established
  forever.\u201D\u2009\u2019\u2009\u201D\n\n    to Hebrews 1:8-9\n    Hebrews 1:8-9\n\n
  \   8But of the Son He says,\n\n    \u201CYour throne, O God, is forever and ever,\n\n
  \   And the righteous scepter is the scepter of His kingdom.\n\n    9You have loved
  righteousness and hated lawlessness;\n\n    Therefore God, Your God, has anointed
  You\n\n    With the oil of gladness above Your companions.\u201D\n\n    . How does
  King Jesus embody and fulfill the ancient promises of God (e.g. John 1:14\n    John
  1:14\n\n    The Word Made Flesh\n\n    14And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among
  us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of
  grace and truth.\n\n    , Hebrews 3:5-6\n    Hebrews 3:5-6\n\n    5Now Moses was
  faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were
  to be spoken later; 6but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house\u2014whose
  house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until
  the end.\n\n    , and Romans 15:8-9\n    Romans 15:8-9\n\n    8For I say that Christ
  has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm
  the promises given to the fathers, 9and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His
  mercy; as it is written,\n\n    \u201CTherefore I will give praise to You among
  the Gentiles,\n\n    And I will sing to Your name.\u201D\n\n    )?\n!!! note \"4\"\n\n
  \   Read Hebrews 10:22-25\n    Hebrews 10:22-25\n\n    22let us draw near with a
  sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from
  an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. 23Let us hold fast the
  confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful; 24and
  let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, 25not forsaking
  our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another;
  and all the more as you see the day drawing near.\n\n    , Hebrews 11\n    Hebrews
  11\n\n    The Triumphs of Faith\n\n    1Now faith is the assurance of things hoped
  for, the conviction of things not seen. 2For by it the men of old gained approval.\n\n
  \   3By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so
  that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible. 4By faith Abel offered
  to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that
  he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is
  dead, he still speaks. 5By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death;
  and he was not found because God took him up; for he obtained the witness that before
  his being taken up he was pleasing to God. 6And without faith it is impossible to
  please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder
  of those who seek Him. 7By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet
  seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which
  he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according
  to faith.\n\n    8By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a
  place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where
  he was going. 9By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign
  land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise;
  10for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder
  is God. 11By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive, even beyond
  the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised. 12Therefore
  there was born even of one man, and him as good as dead at that, as many descendants
  as the stars of heaven in number, and innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.\n\n
  \   13All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them
  and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers
  and exiles on the earth. 14For those who say such things make it clear that they
  are seeking a country of their own. 15And indeed if they had been thinking of that
  country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return. 16But
  as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is
  not ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them.\n\n    17By
  faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the
  promises was offering up his only begotten son; 18it was he to whom it was said,
  \u201CIn Isaac your descendants shall be called.\u201D 19He considered that God
  is able to raise people even from the dead, from which he also received him back
  as a type. 20By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come.
  21By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped,
  leaning on the top of his staff. 22By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention
  of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.\n\n    23By
  faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because
  they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king\u2019s edict.
  24By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh\u2019s
  daughter, 25choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than
  to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, 26considering the reproach of Christ greater
  riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward. 27By faith
  he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him
  who is unseen. 28By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood,
  so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. 29By faith they passed
  through the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry land; and the Egyptians,
  when they attempted it, were drowned.\n\n    30By faith the walls of Jericho fell
  down after they had been encircled for seven days. 31By faith Rahab the harlot did
  not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies
  in peace.\n\n    32And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of
  Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, 33who by
  faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut
  the mouths of lions, 34quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,
  from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.
  35Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not
  accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection; 36and
  others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment. 37They
  were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with
  the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted,
  ill-treated 38(men of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains
  and caves and holes in the ground.\n\n    39And all these, having gained approval
  through their faith, did not receive what was promised, 40because God had provided
  something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.\n\n
  \   , and Hebrews 12:1-3\n    Hebrews 12:1-3\n\n    Jesus, the Example\n\n    1Therefore,
  since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside
  every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with
  endurance the race that is set before us, 2fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author
  and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising
  the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.\n\n    3For
  consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that
  you will not grow weary and lose heart.\n\n    . After reading these passages, name
  one example of what it looks like to put our trust in God."

    note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">1</p>\n<p>The Hebrew word \u201Cemet\u201D
    is translated with words like \u201Cfaithful,\u201D\n\u201Creliable,\u201D \u201Csure,\u201D
    \u201Ctrustworthy,\u201D and \u201Camen.\u201D Read aloud Psalm 36:5-6 ,\nPsalm
    19:7 , and Psalm 41:13 and discuss what the psalmists are\ncommunicating in these
    passages when they use the word \u201Cemet.\u201D</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition
    scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Psalms 36:5-6</p>\n<p>5Your lovingkindness,
    O Lord, extends to the heavens,</p>\n<p>Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.</p>\n<p>6Your
    righteousness is like the mountains of God;</p>\n<p>Your judgments are like a
    great deep.</p>\n<p>O Lord, You preserve man and beast.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition
    scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Psalms 19:7</p>\n<p>7The law of the
    Lord is perfect, restoring the soul;</p>\n<p>The testimony of the Lord is sure,
    making wise the simple.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Psalms 41:13</p>\n</div>\n<pre><code>13Blessed be the
    Lord, the God of Israel,\n\nFrom everlasting to everlasting.\n\nAmen and Amen.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I
    think the lesson here is pretty simple - God is faithful, full stop. His\nfaithfulness
    doesn't look necessarily like how we might want... when I was a\nkid I would be
    upset if my parents didn't respond to me in the way I wanted,\nand my kids will
    certainly share that disappointment. But I am faithful to my\nchildren - sometimes
    the main issue is a child's outlook on a situation or\nworldview. I think that
    metaphor holds true in relation to humans and Yahweh -\nhe sees the whole world,
    we see a part of it so we cannot understand\nfaithfulness fully, in the same way
    that my children can't understand my\nfaithfulness to them fully - even to the
    point of being upset or thinking that\n<em>I'm not being faithful</em></p>\n<div
    class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">2</p>\n<p>God promised
    the Israelites that he would give them a king of peace that\nwould rule forever
    and ever (e.g. 2 Samuel 7:16). However, Israel\u2019s kingdom\ncollapsed and they
    found themselves without a home or a king. Compare the\nbeginning of Psalm 89
    (vv. 1-10) with the way it closes (vv. 46-52). What\ndo you think it practically
    looks like to trust God when all seems lost?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition
    scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">2 Samuel 7:16</p>\n<p>16Your house
    and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established
    forever.\u201D\u2009\u2019\u2009\u201D</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">PSALM 89</p>\n<p>The Lord\u2019s Covenant with David,
    and Israel\u2019s Afflictions.</p>\n<p>A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.</p>\n<p>1I
    will sing of the lovingkindness of the Lord forever;</p>\n<p>To all generations
    I will make known Your faithfulness with my mouth.</p>\n<p>2For I have said, \u201CLovingkindness
    will be built up forever;</p>\n<p>In the heavens You will establish Your faithfulness.\u201D</p>\n<p>3\u201CI
    have made a covenant with My chosen;</p>\n<p>I have sworn to David My servant,</p>\n<p>4I
    will establish your seed forever</p>\n<p>And build up your throne to all generations.\u201D
    Selah.</p>\n<p>5The heavens will praise Your wonders, O Lord;</p>\n<p>Your faithfulness
    also in the assembly of the holy ones.</p>\n<p>6For who in the skies is comparable
    to the Lord?</p>\n<p>Who among the sons of the mighty is like the Lord,</p>\n<p>7A
    God greatly feared in the council of the holy ones,</p>\n<p>And awesome above
    all those who are around Him?</p>\n<p>8O Lord God of hosts, who is like You, O
    mighty Lord?</p>\n<p>Your faithfulness also surrounds You.</p>\n<p>9You rule the
    swelling of the sea;</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">3</p>\n<p>Ultimately,
    God answers the psalmist\u2019s cries in the person of Jesus. Compare 2 Samuel
    7:16\n2 Samuel 7:16</p>\n<p>16Your house and your kingdom shall endure before
    Me forever; your throne shall be established forever.\u201D\u2009\u2019\u2009\u201D</p>\n<p>to
    Hebrews 1:8-9\nHebrews 1:8-9</p>\n<p>8But of the Son He says,</p>\n<p>\u201CYour
    throne, O God, is forever and ever,</p>\n<p>And the righteous scepter is the scepter
    of His kingdom.</p>\n<p>9You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;</p>\n<p>Therefore
    God, Your God, has anointed You</p>\n<p>With the oil of gladness above Your companions.\u201D</p>\n<p>.
    How does King Jesus embody and fulfill the ancient promises of God (e.g. John
    1:14\nJohn 1:14</p>\n<p>The Word Made Flesh</p>\n<p>14And the Word became flesh,
    and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the
    Father, full of grace and truth.</p>\n<p>, Hebrews 3:5-6\nHebrews 3:5-6</p>\n<p>5Now
    Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things
    which were to be spoken later; 6but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house\u2014whose
    house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until
    the end.</p>\n<p>, and Romans 15:8-9\nRomans 15:8-9</p>\n<p>8For I say that Christ
    has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm
    the promises given to the fathers, 9and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His
    mercy; as it is written,</p>\n<p>\u201CTherefore I will give praise to You among
    the Gentiles,</p>\n<p>And I will sing to Your name.\u201D</p>\n<p>)?</p>\n</div>\n<div
    class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">4</p>\n<p>Read Hebrews
    10:22-25\nHebrews 10:22-25</p>\n<p>22let us draw near with a sincere heart in
    full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience
    and our bodies washed with pure water. 23Let us hold fast the confession of our
    hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful; 24and let us consider
    how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, 25not forsaking our own assembling
    together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more
    as you see the day drawing near.</p>\n<p>, Hebrews 11\nHebrews 11</p>\n<p>The
    Triumphs of Faith</p>\n<p>1Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the
    conviction of things not seen. 2For by it the men of old gained approval.</p>\n<p>3By
    faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that
    what is seen was not made out of things which are visible. 4By faith Abel offered
    to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that
    he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he
    is dead, he still speaks. 5By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see
    death; and he was not found because God took him up; for he obtained the witness
    that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God. 6And without faith it is
    impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and
    that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him. 7By faith Noah, being warned by God
    about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his
    household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness
    which is according to faith.</p>\n<p>8By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed
    by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went
    out, not knowing where he was going. 9By faith he lived as an alien in the land
    of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow
    heirs of the same promise; 10for he was looking for the city which has foundations,
    whose architect and builder is God. 11By faith even Sarah herself received ability
    to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful
    who had promised. 12Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good
    as dead at that, as many descendants as the stars of heaven in number, and innumerable
    as the sand which is by the seashore.</p>\n<p>13All these died in faith, without
    receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance,
    and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. 14For those
    who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.
    15And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out,
    they would have had opportunity to return. 16But as it is, they desire a better
    country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their
    God; for He has prepared a city for them.</p>\n<p>17By faith Abraham, when he
    was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering
    up his only begotten son; 18it was he to whom it was said, \u201CIn Isaac your
    descendants shall be called.\u201D 19He considered that God is able to raise people
    even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type. 20By faith
    Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come. 21By faith Jacob,
    as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on
    the top of his staff. 22By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the
    exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.</p>\n<p>23By
    faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because
    they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king\u2019s
    edict. 24By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of
    Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, 25choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people
    of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, 26considering the reproach
    of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the
    reward. 27By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured,
    as seeing Him who is unseen. 28By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling
    of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. 29By
    faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry
    land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.</p>\n<p>30By faith
    the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. 31By
    faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after
    she had welcomed the spies in peace.</p>\n<p>32And what more shall I say? For
    time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel
    and the prophets, 33who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness,
    obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, 34quenched the power of fire, escaped
    the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put
    foreign armies to flight. 35Women received back their dead by resurrection; and
    others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a
    better resurrection; 36and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also
    chains and imprisonment. 37They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were
    tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins,
    in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated 38(men of whom the world
    was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the
    ground.</p>\n<p>39And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did
    not receive what was promised, 40because God had provided something better for
    us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.</p>\n<p>, and Hebrews
    12:1-3\nHebrews 12:1-3</p>\n<p>Jesus, the Example</p>\n<p>1Therefore, since we
    have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every
    encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance
    the race that is set before us, 2fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter
    of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame,
    and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</p>\n<p>3For consider
    Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will
    not grow weary and lose heart.</p>\n<p>. After reading these passages, name one
    example of what it looks like to put our trust in God.</p>\n</div>\n\n        </section>\n

    think the lesson here is pretty simple - God is faithful, full stop. His\nfaithfulness
    doesn't look necessarily like how we might want... when I was a\nkid I would be
    upset if my parents didn't respond to me in the way I wanted,\nand my kids will
    certainly share that disappointment. But I am faithful to my\nchildren - sometimes
    the main issue is a child's outlook on a situation or\nworldview. I think that
    metaphor holds true in relation to humans and Yahweh -\nhe sees the whole world,
    we see a part of it so we cannot understand\nfaithfulness fully, in the same way
    that my children can't understand my\nfaithfulness to them fully - even to the
    point of being upset or thinking that\n<em>I'm not being faithful</em></p>\n<div

    the Israelites that he would give them a king of peace that\nwould rule forever
    and ever (e.g. 2 Samuel 7:16). However, Israel\u2019s kingdom\ncollapsed and they
    found themselves without a home or a king. Compare the\nbeginning of Psalm 89
    (vv. 1-10) with the way it closes (vv. 46-52). What\ndo you think it practically
    looks like to trust God when all seems lost?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition

    How does King Jesus embody and fulfill the ancient promises of God (e.g. John
    1:14\nJohn 1:14</p>\n<p>The Word Made Flesh</p>\n<p>14And the Word became flesh,
    and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the
    Father, full of grace and truth.</p>\n<p>, Hebrews 3:5-6\nHebrews 3:5-6</p>\n<p>5Now
    Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things
    which were to be spoken later; 6but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house\u2014whose
    house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until
    the end.</p>\n<p>, and Romans 15:8-9\nRomans 15:8-9</p>\n<p>8For I say that Christ
    has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm
    the promises given to the fathers, 9and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His
    mercy; as it is written,</p>\n<p>\u201CTherefore I will give praise to You among

    10:22-25\nHebrews 10:22-25</p>\n<p>22let us draw near with a sincere heart in
    full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience
    and our bodies washed with pure water. 23Let us hold fast the confession of our
    hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful; 24and let us consider
    how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, 25not forsaking our own assembling
    together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more
    as you see the day drawing near.</p>\n<p>, Hebrews 11\nHebrews 11</p>\n<p>The
    Triumphs of Faith</p>\n<p>1Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the
    conviction of things not seen. 2For by it the men of old gained approval.</p>\n<p>3By
    faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that
    what is seen was not made out of things which are visible. 4By faith Abel offered
    to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that
    he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he
    is dead, he still speaks. 5By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see
    death; and he was not found because God took him up; for he obtained the witness
    that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God. 6And without faith it is
    impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and
    that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him. 7By faith Noah, being warned by God
    about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his
    household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness
    which is according to faith.</p>\n<p>8By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed
    by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went
    out, not knowing where he was going. 9By faith he lived as an alien in the land
    of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow
    heirs of the same promise; 10for he was looking for the city which has foundations,
    whose architect and builder is God. 11By faith even Sarah herself received ability
    to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful
    who had promised. 12Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good
    as dead at that, as many descendants as the stars of heaven in number, and innumerable
    as the sand which is by the seashore.</p>\n<p>13All these died in faith, without
    receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance,
    and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. 14For those
    who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.
    15And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out,
    they would have had opportunity to return. 16But as it is, they desire a better
    country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their
    God; for He has prepared a city for them.</p>\n<p>17By faith Abraham, when he
    was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering
    up his only begotten son; 18it was he to whom it was said, \u201CIn Isaac your
    descendants shall be called.\u201D 19He considered that God is able to raise people
    even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type. 20By faith
    Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come. 21By faith Jacob,
    as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on
    the top of his staff. 22By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the
    exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.</p>\n<p>23By
    faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because
    they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king\u2019s
    edict. 24By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of
    Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, 25choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people
    of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, 26considering the reproach
    of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the
    reward. 27By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured,
    as seeing Him who is unseen. 28By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling
    of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. 29By
    faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry
    land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.</p>\n<p>30By faith
    the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. 31By
    faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after
    she had welcomed the spies in peace.</p>\n<p>32And what more shall I say? For
    time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel
    and the prophets, 33who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness,
    obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, 34quenched the power of fire, escaped
    the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put
    foreign armies to flight. 35Women received back their dead by resurrection; and
    others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a
    better resurrection; 36and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also
    chains and imprisonment. 37They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were
    tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins,
    in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated 38(men of whom the world
    was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the
    ground.</p>\n<p>39And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did
    not receive what was promised, 40because God had provided something better for
    us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.</p>\n<p>, and Hebrews
    12:1-3\nHebrews 12:1-3</p>\n<p>Jesus, the Example</p>\n<p>1Therefore, since we
    have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every
    encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance
    the race that is set before us, 2fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter
    of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame,
    and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</p>\n<p>3For consider
    Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will
    not grow weary and lose heart.</p>\n<p>. After reading these passages, name one
    example of what it looks like to put our trust in God.</p>\n</div>\n\n        </section>\n

    \u201Ctrustworthy,\u201D and \u201Camen.\u201D Read aloud Psalm 36:5-6 ,\nPsalm

    think the lesson here is pretty simple - God is faithful, full stop. His\nfaithfulness
    doesn't look necessarily like how we might want... when I was a\nkid I would be
    upset if my parents didn't respond to me in the way I wanted,\nand my kids will
    certainly share that disappointment. But I am faithful to my\nchildren - sometimes
    the main issue is a child's outlook on a situation or\nworldview. I think that
    metaphor holds true in relation to humans and Yahweh -\nhe sees the whole world,
    we see a part of it so we cannot understand\nfaithfulness fully, in the same way
    that my children can't understand my\nfaithfulness to them fully - even to the
    point of being upset or thinking that\n<em>I'm not being faithful</em></p>\n<div

    the Israelites that he would give them a king of peace that\nwould rule forever
    and ever (e.g. 2 Samuel 7:16). However, Israel\u2019s kingdom\ncollapsed and they
    found themselves without a home or a king. Compare the\nbeginning of Psalm 89
    (vv. 1-10) with the way it closes (vv. 46-52). What\ndo you think it practically
    looks like to trust God when all seems lost?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition

    God, Your God, has anointed You</p>\n<p>With the oil of gladness above Your companions.\u201D</p>\n<p>.
    How does King Jesus embody and fulfill the ancient promises of God (e.g. John
    1:14\nJohn 1:14</p>\n<p>The Word Made Flesh</p>\n<p>14And the Word became flesh,
    and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the
    Father, full of grace and truth.</p>\n<p>, Hebrews 3:5-6\nHebrews 3:5-6</p>\n<p>5Now
    Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things
    which were to be spoken later; 6but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house\u2014whose
    house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until
    the end.</p>\n<p>, and Romans 15:8-9\nRomans 15:8-9</p>\n<p>8For I say that Christ
    has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm
    the promises given to the fathers, 9and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His
    mercy; as it is written,</p>\n<p>\u201CTherefore I will give praise to You among

    class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">4</p>\n<p>Read Hebrews
    10:22-25\nHebrews 10:22-25</p>\n<p>22let us draw near with a sincere heart in
    full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience
    and our bodies washed with pure water. 23Let us hold fast the confession of our
    hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful; 24and let us consider
    how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, 25not forsaking our own assembling
    together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more
    as you see the day drawing near.</p>\n<p>, Hebrews 11\nHebrews 11</p>\n<p>The
    Triumphs of Faith</p>\n<p>1Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the
    conviction of things not seen. 2For by it the men of old gained approval.</p>\n<p>3By
    faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that
    what is seen was not made out of things which are visible. 4By faith Abel offered
    to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that
    he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he
    is dead, he still speaks. 5By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see
    death; and he was not found because God took him up; for he obtained the witness
    that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God. 6And without faith it is
    impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and
    that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him. 7By faith Noah, being warned by God
    about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his
    household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness
    which is according to faith.</p>\n<p>8By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed
    by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went
    out, not knowing where he was going. 9By faith he lived as an alien in the land
    of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow
    heirs of the same promise; 10for he was looking for the city which has foundations,
    whose architect and builder is God. 11By faith even Sarah herself received ability
    to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful
    who had promised. 12Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good
    as dead at that, as many descendants as the stars of heaven in number, and innumerable
    as the sand which is by the seashore.</p>\n<p>13All these died in faith, without
    receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance,
    and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. 14For those
    who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.
    15And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out,
    they would have had opportunity to return. 16But as it is, they desire a better
    country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their
    God; for He has prepared a city for them.</p>\n<p>17By faith Abraham, when he
    was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering
    up his only begotten son; 18it was he to whom it was said, \u201CIn Isaac your
    descendants shall be called.\u201D 19He considered that God is able to raise people
    even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type. 20By faith
    Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come. 21By faith Jacob,
    as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on
    the top of his staff. 22By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the
    exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.</p>\n<p>23By
    faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because
    they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king\u2019s
    edict. 24By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of
    Pharaoh\u2019s daughter, 25choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people
    of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, 26considering the reproach
    of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the
    reward. 27By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured,
    as seeing Him who is unseen. 28By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling
    of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. 29By
    faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry
    land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.</p>\n<p>30By faith
    the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. 31By
    faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after
    she had welcomed the spies in peace.</p>\n<p>32And what more shall I say? For
    time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel
    and the prophets, 33who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness,
    obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, 34quenched the power of fire, escaped
    the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put
    foreign armies to flight. 35Women received back their dead by resurrection; and
    others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a
    better resurrection; 36and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also
    chains and imprisonment. 37They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were
    tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins,
    in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated 38(men of whom the world
    was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the
    ground.</p>\n<p>39And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did
    not receive what was promised, 40because God had provided something better for
    us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.</p>\n<p>, and Hebrews
    12:1-3\nHebrews 12:1-3</p>\n<p>Jesus, the Example</p>\n<p>1Therefore, since we
    have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every
    encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance
    the race that is set before us, 2fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter
    of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame,
    and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</p>\n<p>3For consider
    Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will
    not grow weary and lose heart.</p>\n<p>. After reading these passages, name one
    example of what it looks like to put our trust in God.</p>\n</div>\n\n        </div>\n

    to \"Amen\" which is untranslated Hebrew expression meaning \"that's truth\"\n\n##
    Stability\n\nMoses has to hold his hands up when Israel faces the Amalekites.
    Joshua (and another) bring Moses a rock to sit on and hold is hands up so they
    could be Emet.\n\n## People\n\nDescribs trustiworthiness \n\nExodus 18:21 - Moses
    apoints leaders are to be \"Emet\"\n\n## God and promises\n\nGod is a rock - he
    is faithful, just, and upright\n\nHebrew word for trust is He'Emin which is the
    verb form of Emet\n\nAbraham considers God Emet, he He'Emin's God and God blesses
    this by creating Isreal.\n\nIsrael, In Exodus 14:31, He'Emin's God (until they
    see the gians in Canaan that is)\n\n1 Kings 1:6 says David walked in Emet with
    God\n\n2 Samuel 7:16, God blesses David and says his kingdom will have Emet\n\nRomans
    15:8-9 says Jesus came on behalf of God's faithfulness.\n\n# Questions\n\n!!!
    note \"1\"\n\n    The Hebrew word \u201Cemet\u201D is translated with words like

    was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is
    dead, he still speaks. 5By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death;
    and he was not found because God took him up; for he obtained the witness that
    before his being taken up he was pleasing to God. 6And without faith it is impossible
    to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is
    a rewarder of those who seek Him. 7By faith Noah, being warned by God about things
    not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household,
    by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which
    is according to faith.\n\n    8By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by
    going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out,
    not knowing where he was going. 9By faith he lived as an alien in the land of
    promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow
    heirs of the same promise; 10for he was looking for the city which has foundations,
    whose architect and builder is God. 11By faith even Sarah herself received ability
    to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful
    who had promised. 12Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good
    as dead at that, as many descendants as the stars of heaven in number, and innumerable
    as the sand which is by the seashore.\n\n    13All these died in faith, without
    receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance,
    and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. 14For those
    who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own.
    15And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out,
    they would have had opportunity to return. 16But as it is, they desire a better
    country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their
    God; for He has prepared a city for them.\n\n    17By faith Abraham, when he was
    tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering up
    his only begotten son; 18it was he to whom it was said, \u201CIn Isaac your descendants
    shall be called.\u201D 19He considered that God is able to raise people even from
    the dead, from which he also received him back as a type. 20By faith Isaac blessed
    Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come. 21By faith Jacob, as he was dying,
    blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.
    22By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of
    Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.\n\n    23By faith Moses, when he
    was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was
    a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king\u2019s edict. 24By faith
    Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh\u2019s daughter,
    25choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy
    the passing pleasures of sin, 26considering the reproach of Christ greater riches
    than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward. 27By faith he left
    Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is
    unseen. 28By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that
    he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. 29By faith they passed through
    the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry land; and the Egyptians, when
    they attempted it, were drowned.\n\n    30By faith the walls of Jericho fell down
    after they had been encircled for seven days. 31By faith Rahab the harlot did
    not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies
    in peace.\n\n    32And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell
    of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, 33who
    by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises,
    shut the mouths of lions, 34quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the
    sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies
    to flight. 35Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured,
    not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection;
    36and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment.
    37They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to
    death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute,
    afflicted, ill-treated 38(men of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in
    deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground.\n\n    39And all these,
    having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised,
    40because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they
    would not be made perfect.\n\n    , and Hebrews 12:1-3\n    Hebrews 12:1-3\n\n
    \   Jesus, the Example\n\n    1Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses
    surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily
    entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2fixing
    our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before
    Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand
    of the throne of God.\n\n    3For consider Him who has endured such hostility
    by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.\n\n

# Notes

!!! Exodusds 34:6

    Compassioante and gracious, slow to anger, overflowing with loyal love and faithfulness

Faithfulness - Emet (can be translated 'Truth')
Related to "Amen" which is untranslated Hebrew expression meaning "that's truth"

## Stability

Moses has to hold his hands up when Israel faces the Amalekites. Joshua (and another) bring Moses a rock to sit on and hold is hands up so they could be Emet.

## People

Describs trustiworthiness 

Exodus 18:21 - Moses apoints leaders are to be "Emet"

## God and promises

God is a rock - he is faithful, just, and upright

Hebrew word for trust is He'Emin which is the verb form of Emet

Abraham considers God Emet, he He'Emin's God and God blesses this by creating Isreal.

Israel, In Exodus 14:31, He'Emin's God (until they see the gians in Canaan that is)

1 Kings 1:6 says David walked in Emet with God

2 Samuel 7:16, God blesses David and says his kingdom will have Emet

Romans 15:8-9 says Jesus came on behalf of God's faithfulness.

# Questions

!!! note "1"

    The Hebrew word “emet” is translated with words like “faithful,”
    “reliable,” “sure,” “trustworthy,” and “amen.” Read aloud Psalm 36:5-6 ,
    Psalm 19:7 , and Psalm 41:13 and discuss what the psalmists are
    communicating in these passages when they use the word “emet.”

!!! scripture "Psalms 36:5-6"

    5Your lovingkindness, O Lord, extends to the heavens,

    Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.

    6Your righteousness is like the mountains of God;

    Your judgments are like a great deep.

    O Lord, You preserve man and beast.


!!! scripture "Psalms 19:7"

    7The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul;

    The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.


!!! scripture "Psalms 41:13"


    13Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,

    From everlasting to everlasting.

    Amen and Amen.


I think the lesson here is pretty simple - God is faithful, full stop. His
faithfulness doesn't look necessarily like how we might want... when I was a
kid I would be upset if my parents didn't respond to me in the way I wanted,
and my kids will certainly share that disappointment. But I am faithful to my
children - sometimes the main issue is a child's outlook on a situation or
worldview. I think that metaphor holds true in relation to humans and Yahweh -
he sees the whole world, we see a part of it so we cannot understand
faithfulness fully, in the same way that my children can't understand my
faithfulness to them fully - even to the point of being upset or thinking that
_I'm not being faithful_

!!! note "2"

    God promised the Israelites that he would give them a king of peace that
    would rule forever and ever (e.g. 2 Samuel 7:16). However, Israel’s kingdom
    collapsed and they found themselves without a home or a king. Compare the
    beginning of Psalm 89 (vv. 1-10) with the way it closes (vv. 46-52). What
    do you think it practically looks like to trust God when all seems lost?

!!! scripture "2 Samuel 7:16"

    16Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever.” ’ ”

!!! scripture "PSALM 89"

    The Lord’s Covenant with David, and Israel’s Afflictions.

    A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.

    1I will sing of the lovingkindness of the Lord forever;

    To all generations I will make known Your faithfulness with my mouth.

    2For I have said, “Lovingkindness will be built up forever;

    In the heavens You will establish Your faithfulness.”

    3“I have made a covenant with My chosen;

    I have sworn to David My servant,

    4I will establish your seed forever

    And build up your throne to all generations.” Selah.

    5The heavens will praise Your wonders, O Lord;

    Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.

    6For who in the skies is comparable to the Lord?

    Who among the sons of the mighty is like the Lord,

    7A God greatly feared in the council of the holy ones,

    And awesome above all those who are around Him?

    8O Lord God of hosts, who is like You, O mighty Lord?

    Your faithfulness also surrounds You.

    9You rule the swelling of the sea;


!!! note "3"

    Ultimately, God answers the psalmist’s cries in the person of Jesus. Compare 2 Samuel 7:16
    2 Samuel 7:16

    16Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever.” ’ ”

    to Hebrews 1:8-9
    Hebrews 1:8-9

    8But of the Son He says,

    “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,

    And the righteous scepter is the scepter of His kingdom.

    9You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;

    Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You

    With the oil of gladness above Your companions.”

    . How does King Jesus embody and fulfill the ancient promises of God (e.g. John 1:14
    John 1:14

    The Word Made Flesh

    14And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.

    Hebrews 3:5-6

    5Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later; 6but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house—whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end.

    , and Romans 15:8-9
    Romans 15:8-9

    8For I say that Christ has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm the promises given to the fathers, 9and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written,

    “Therefore I will give praise to You among the Gentiles,

    And I will sing to Your name.”

    Hebrews 10:22-25

    22let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. 23Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful; 24and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, 25not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.

    The Triumphs of Faith

    1Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. 2For by it the men of old gained approval.

    3By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible. 4By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks. 5By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; and he was not found because God took him up; for he obtained the witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God. 6And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him. 7By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.

    8By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going. 9By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise; 10for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 11By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised. 12Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good as dead at that, as many descendants as the stars of heaven in number, and innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.

    13All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. 14For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own. 15And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return. 16But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one.

    30By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. 31By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies in peace.

    32And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, 33who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, 34quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. 35Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection; 36and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment. 37They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated 38(men of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground.

    39And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised, 40because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.

    , and Hebrews 12:1-3
    Hebrews 12:1-3

    Jesus, the Example

    1Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

    3For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.

    . After reading these passages, name one example of what it looks like to put our trust in God.
