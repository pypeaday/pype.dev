<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">1 John 4:7–10 (CSB)</p>
<p>7 Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God. 8 The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 9 God’s love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his one and only Son into the world so that we might live through him. 10 Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.</p>
</div>
<p>&quot;not that we loved God, but that he loved us&quot;</p>
<p>Can a newborn love? When a baby enters the world they are at the mercy of the,
hopefully, loving mom and dad God gave to them. But, whatever circumstances
surround them - they didn't choose any of it. As the child is loved then
out of that love they develop an affection and love of their own toward Mom and
Dad.</p>
<p>So, to love God is only possible out of the love he shows you and me, just like
a child will develop love for Mom and Dad as they are shown love. He shows
grace to all.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Palm 145:9</p>
<p>Yahweh is good to all,  and his mercies are over all his works.</p>
</div>
<p>And just like Yahweh is good to all, I will show grace to anyone else's kid -
but God redeems his own just like at the end of the day I take my own kids
home: my kids, who I loved before they could love me. Anyone who is not a child
of God cannot love God - John says as much in what we just read together.</p>
<p>But love is more than affection, and even security. It is those things of
course, but it's also more. Something else that love brings to the human life,
is freedom.</p>
<p>My kids don't get to do just whatever they want - but they're never more free
than when they are enjoying life within the boundaries I have set for them, out
of my deep love for them. My love for my kids enables them to be as free as
reasonably possible... The epitome of freedom for the human is not &quot;doing
whatever I want&quot;, that is slavery to human flesh. No, true freedom is the gift
of loving the Lord because loving him is the reason we were created - it's what
we were made to do. His love for me frees me to want what he wants, love
what he loves, hate what he hates, and ultimately to enjoy him forever.</p>
<p>I hope my kids love what I love, and hate what I hate because I hope that what
I love and what I hate are in line with God's heart. And as God sent his own
son into the world out of his love for you and me, may we go forward freed from
the bondage of sin and death, into the glorious, true, and loving freedom that
Jesus brings.</p>

<p>Good morning, Father. Thank you for Love, thank you for Christmas. For those
here who have been freed to love you I pray this week and through Christmas we
are drawn to consider the freedom we have in your love, the freedom to love
you, the freedom to choose what is pleasing to you and not what our
sinful-selves demand. For those here still dead in their sins, unable to love
you, I pray you speak their name and call them to life and to freedom. We long
for your return as we celebrate your incarnation. Thank you for loving us
before we could love you, now may we love you and others this week, in Jesus'
name. Amen.</p>
