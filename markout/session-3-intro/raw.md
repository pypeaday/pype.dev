# Intro 

Session 1: Torah

Session 2: Prophets and Writings

# Review

## Torah

Big idea: partnership

* Basis of partnership / meet the characters (Genesis)
* God chooses a partner / the partner chooses God (Exodus)
* God defines the partnership (Leviticus)
* God shapes his partner (Numbers)
* God asks his partner to remember (Deuteronomy)

## History

Big idea: Redemption cycle; God's patience

* God places His people in the middle of the action for mission (Joshua)
* God’s people struggle to walk the path and trust the story (Judges & Ruth)
* God’s people struggle with identity and obedience (Samuel/Kings)
* God’s people struggle with empire and becoming the anti-story (Chronicles)

## Wisdom

Big idea: Tools

__If we are going to survive the cycle, we are going to need...__

* Art and song for worship and expression (Psalms)
* Nuggets of conventional wisdom (Proverbs)
* Purpose and a reason to get up every morning (Ecclesiastes)
* Relationships and intimacy with others (Song of Songs)

## Prophets 

Big idea: Warnings, woes, and hope

* God sends warning in Pre-Assyrian/Pre-Babylonian prophets (Amos, Hosea, Micah, 1 Isaiah, Zephaniah, 2 Isaiah)
* God pronounces woe and judgment (Jonah, Nahum, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Habakkuk, Obadiah, Joel)
* God gives hope and encouragement to an exiled people (Ezekiel, Daniel, Job, 3 Isaiah)

## Remnant

Big idea: Returning, yearning, learning

* God’s people return to rebuild and restore what once was (4 Isaiah, Ezra/Nehemiah)
* God’s people yearn for what used to be (Haggai, Zechariah)
* God’s people learn that this new world demands a new approach (Malachi, Esther)

## The Silent Years

We run out of Biblical text but there's centuries of histories between the
ending of the OT and Jesus coming onto the scene
