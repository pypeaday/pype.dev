## UFO

Ok this is crazy but 2 nights ago I saw a UFO, or like 5 of them, and I wrote something about them and am now just gonna put some thoughts here... publicity be damned

### Description

- 4-pointed star, inner-curved, lights moving through the sky
- The light was a shimmering green/aquamarine
- I saw 2 small and 1 big lights where the big one split up and that turned into 5 total objects
- Thought it might've been the Northern Lights, but that would've been the whole sky or something larger, and visible for longer... this was like a plane flying across the horizon, except it was night and 5 UFOs

- The flight pattern of the lights was like fighter jets, that's how I would describe the movement and like flight characteristics that I would just expect to see if some F15s flew by or something.
  It was faster than a commercial plane but not faster than I could imagine a jet flying by, and like coordinated movement between all of them

### Possibilities

- Drone: real possibility and I already don't know what of my memory that I can trust but... I think I would've recognized something like a drone at the time, I can't really convince anyone of that but I just would like to think that I would've thought "wtf is that... oh it's a drone"
- Plane: No, I've never seen shimmering lights like this on a regular plane
