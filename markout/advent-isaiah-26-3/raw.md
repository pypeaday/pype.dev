!!! note "Isaiah 26:3"

    You will protect a firm inclination in peace,  in peace because he trusts in you.

This is reminding me of a blog post I've had in the queue for months
[[autism-and-steadfast-faith]] which may never see the light of day but it ties
in with this verse too well to not influence my reflection on it

## A Firm Inclination

What is this? I had to open another translation to get the idea, consider the ESV:

!!! note "Isaiah 26:3"

    You keep him in perfect peace  whose mind is stayed on you,  because he trusts in you.

I'm not going to attempt to explain any Hebrew in this one, I'm not fluent in
it and this looks like more than a 1 word translation to me

So in observation "sa-muk ye-ser" is the man "whose mind is stayed on (Yahweh)"
is "_the man with_ a firm inclination"

So it's an `attitude` - an _inclincation_ to trust in the Lord... I definitely
want to avoid going down any theological paths about the order of salvation,
but personally this is resonating deeply as I describe myself (as do others
probably) as a man with a firm inclination to worship and follow Jesus.

For me, obviously the source of the "sa-muk ye-ser" is Yahweh himself, but the
outpouring of his blessing of "a firm inclination" in me is in the form of
autism I think... Through my make-up as a human, the traits that got me labeled
_autistic_ are also many of the ones that have led me to study and lay the
foundation of my faith in Jesus by nothing other than his grace.

For a long time, biblical theology was my "special interest of autistic
degrees", and although I'm not drowning in technical papers about Divine
Council Theology at the moment, the seasons and experiences that were
enabled/affected by being autistic have given me, by God's grace, a history of
life to look back on and be encouraged through and have my present-day-faith
strengthened by.

## Advent

Today marks the second week of Advent - Peace.

Praise God for Isaiah 26:3 and honestly praise God for autism in my life.
Through it he has protected and kept me. It's odd to think about but through
the anxiety and turmoil of growing up undiagnosed (actually misdiagnosed -
[[autism-adhd-and-the-doshas]]) autistic, to wrestle with how and why I seemed
to experience reality differently than most of my friends and community, God
brought me to a point of mostly steady peace about the things that happen in my
life.

I've mentioned it in a few writings but right now I feel quite stressed out
about some work-related situations that are outside my control... God's been,
and is being, good. I both sense the peace of knowing that I don't have to
worry about my life, as well as the anxiety present (somewhat rightfully) to
make the decisions that bring the most glory to God.

I don't think "peace" means you can't feel anxiety, we live in the "already but
not yet" so the dual-reality is completely expected. I feel blessed that even
though I'm no stranger to the level of anxiety that can make you physically
sick, I am also no stranger to an ever-present and quiet corner of my heart
that God tends and keeps, strengthens and refreshes, and protects for the sake
of his own glory. Amen.
