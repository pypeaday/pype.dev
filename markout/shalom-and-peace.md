  Peace \n\n!!! note \"\"\n\n    generally means absnese of war\n\nIn Hebrew the word
  is `Shalom` (Greek: Eirene). Basic biblical meeting of\nShalom is \"complete\" or
  \"whole\". ie. a stone with no cracks, or stone wall with\nnogaps or missing grips\n\nReferences
  a complex situation with nothing missing\n\nShalom can refer to a person's well-being...
  Life is complex and when anything\nis out of alignment our Shalom breaks down and
  needs to be restored\n\nTo bring shalom is to make complete or restore\n\nIn Proverbs,
  to reconcile a broken relationship is to make shalom\n\n## Isaiah\n\n\n!!! scripture
  \"Isaiah 9:6-7\"\n\n\n    6 For a child will be born to us, a son will be given
  to us;\n    And the government will rest on His shoulders;\n    And His name will
  be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,\n    Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.\n
  \   7 There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace,\n    On
  the throne of David and over his kingdom,\n    To establish it and to uphold it
  with justice and righteousness\n    From then on and forevermore.\n    The zeal
  of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this. \n\n## Jesus\n\nJesus restores the broken
  relationship between humans and our creator.\n\n!!! scripture\n\n    Ephesians 2:14-15\n\n
  \   Jesus himeself is our _Eirene_\n\n\n# Questions\n\n!!! note \"1\"\n\n    The
  prophet Isaiah looked forward to the arrival of a future king who would\n    make
  a covenant of shalom (peace, well-being) with his people. This king\n    would set
  the world right and heal all that has been harmed. Read Isaiah\n    9:6-7 aloud
  together. What specific words or phrases stand out to you as\n    you observe this
  passage and why?\n\n!!! scripture \"Isaiah 9:6-7 6\"\n\n    For a child will be
  born to us, a son will be given to\n    us; And the government will rest on His
  shoulders; And His name will be\n    called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal
  Father, Prince of Peace.\n    7There will be no end to the increase of His government
  or of peace, On the\n    throne of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and
  to uphold it with\n    justice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The
  zeal of the\n    Lord of hosts will accomplish this.\n\n\nWords that stick out:
  \n    - child\n    - given to us\n    - government will rest\n    - no end to the
  increase\n    - zeal...will accomplish this\n\n!!! note \"2\"\n\n    The prophet
  Isaiah looked forward to the arrival of the Prince of Peace, whose\n    reign would
  lead to eternal shalom. Jesus\u2019 arrival fulfilled Isaiah\u2019s words.\n    Read
  and reflect on Luke 2:9-15 as a group. Why do you think God announced the\n    King\u2019s
  arrival to no-name shepherds? What does this tell you about the nature\n    of God
  and his Kingdom?\n\n!!! scripture \"Luke 2:9-15\"\n\n    9And an angel of the Lord
  suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the\n    Lord shone around them; and
  they were terribly frightened. 10But the angel\n    said to them, \u201CDo not be
  afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great\n    joy which will be for all
  the people; 11for today in the city of David\n    there has been born for you a
  Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 12This will\n    be a sign for you: you will find
  a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a\n    manger.\u201D 13And suddenly there
  appeared with the angel a multitude of the\n    heavenly host praising God and saying,\n\n
  \   14\u201CGlory to God in the highest,\n\n    And on earth peace among men with
  whom He is pleased.\u201D\n\n    15When the angels had gone away from them into
  heaven, the shepherds began\n    saying to one another, \u201CLet us go straight
  to Bethlehem then, and see this\n    thing that has happened which the Lord has
  made known to us.\u201D\n\nAt thsi point it seems obvious that the reason God came
  to the undesirable\ncompany of teh time was to illustrate that the Kingdom of Heaven
  was to be an\nupside down kingdom. Status and power are hinderences under Jesus'
  reign, so he\nbuilds his kingdom (from our perspective) from the ground up.\n\n\n!!!
  note \"3\"\n\n    The biblical story shows how humanity often chooses a way of life
  apart\n    from God and suffers as a result. According to Colossians 1:19-23 , what\n
  \   did God want to do to remedy this pain, and how did he accomplish his\n    desire
  through Jesus?\n\n!!! scripture\n\n    Colossians 1:19-23\n\n    19For it was the
  Father\u2019s good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in\n    Him, 20and through
  Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made\n    peace (\u03B5\u1F30\u03C1\u03B7\u03BD\u03BF\u03C0\u03BF\u03B9\u03AD\u03C9)
  through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things on\n    earth
  or things in heaven.\n\n    21And although you were formerly alienated and hostile
  in mind, engaged in\n    evil deeds, 22yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly
  body through\n    death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and
  beyond\n    reproach\u2014 23if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established
  and\n    steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have\n
  \   heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I,\n
  \   Paul, was made a minister.\n\nGod interacted with Creation as a created being
  himself, holding back\n_something_ in the person of Jesus. On our turf, God showed
  up to revive our\nlifeless souls and call us to live as citizens in his kingdom.\n\n!!!
  note \"4\"\n\n    Jesus offers his peace to all people as a gift. Read Ephesians
  2:11-16 .\n    How did Jesus make peace between two sharply divided people groups
  (Jews\n    and Gentiles), and why did he do it (see Eph. 2:16)?\n\n!!! scripture
  \"Ephesians 2:11-16\"\n\n\n    11Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles
  in the flesh, who are\n    called \u201CUncircumcision\u201D by the so-called \u201CCircumcision,\u201D
  which is performed\n    in the flesh by human hands\u2014 12remember that you were
  at that time separate\n    from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel,
  and strangers to the\n    covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in
  the world. 13But\n    now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been
  brought near by\n    the blood of Christ. 14For He Himself is our peace, who made
  both groups\n    into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, 15by
  abolishing\n    in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained
  in\n    ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus\n
  \   establishing peace, \n\n    16and might reconcile them both in one body to God\n
  \   through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.\n\nJesus broke down
  the dividing wall of Circumcision by fulfilling Torah. No\nlonger do the people
  of God need to be circumcized into the covenant (we have\nbaptism), and no longer
  are God's people separate from the world via outward\nappearances but instead by
  living lives loyal to a different God - to Yahweh\n\n!!! success \"\"\n\n    Jesus
  \"put to death the enmity\" by removing all *spiritually/covenantally relevant*
  barriers that separated Jews from Gentiles\n\n\n!!! note \"5\"\n\n    Now, let\u2019s
  carefully read Ephesians 4:1-3 How can humility, gentleness,\n    patience, and
  love help maintain the unity Jesus calls his followers to?\n    What happens to
  unity when one of these virtues is missing?\n\n!!! scripture \"Ephesians 4:1-3\"\n\n
  \   1Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner\n    worthy
  of the calling with which you have been called, 2with all humility\n    and gentleness,
  with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,\n    3being diligent to
  preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.\n\nThese things don't just
  help maintain unity - they are the postures of life\nJesus builds his Kingdom around
  (second to himself I suppose). Jesus levels the\nplaying field for all people, and
  no one has anymore right to anything than\nanyone else. Things like humility (right
  view of oneself), gentleness,\npatience, love, etc. are necessary for Jesus' kingdom
  to look how he wants it\nto look"

    would lead to eternal shalom. Jesus\u2019 arrival fulfilled Isaiah\u2019s words.\nRead
    and reflect on Luke 2:9-15 as a group. Why do you think God announced the\nKing\u2019s
    arrival to no-name shepherds? What does this tell you about the nature\nof God
    and his Kingdom?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Luke
    2:9-15</p>\n<p>9And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory
    of the\nLord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened. 10But the angel\nsaid
    to them, \u201CDo not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great\njoy
    which will be for all the people; 11for today in the city of David\nthere has
    been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 12This will\nbe a sign for
    you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a\nmanger.\u201D 13And
    suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the\nheavenly host praising
    God and saying,</p>\n<p>14\u201CGlory to God in the highest,</p>\n<p>And on earth
    peace among men with whom He is pleased.\u201D</p>\n<p>15When the angels had gone
    away from them into heaven, the shepherds began\nsaying to one another, \u201CLet
    us go straight to Bethlehem then, and see this\nthing that has happened which
    the Lord has made known to us.\u201D</p>\n</div>\n<p>At thsi point it seems obvious
    that the reason God came to the undesirable\ncompany of teh time was to illustrate
    that the Kingdom of Heaven was to be an\nupside down kingdom. Status and power

    from the ground up.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">3</p>\n<p>The

    1:19-23</p>\n<p>19For it was the Father\u2019s good pleasure for all the fullness
    to dwell in\nHim, 20and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having

    in mind, engaged in\nevil deeds, 22yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly
    body through\ndeath, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and
    beyond\nreproach\u2014 23if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established
    and\nsteadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have\nheard,

    human hands\u2014 12remember that you were at that time separate\nfrom Christ,
    excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the\ncovenants of promise,
    having no hope and without God in the world. 13But\nnow in Christ Jesus you who
    formerly were far off have been brought near by\nthe blood of Christ. 14For He
    Himself is our peace, who made both groups\ninto one and broke down the barrier
    of the dividing wall, 15by abolishing\nin His flesh the enmity, which is the Law
    of commandments contained in\nordinances, so that in Himself He might make the
    two into one new man, thus\nestablishing peace, \n\n16and might reconcile them
    both in one body to God\nthrough the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Jesus
    broke down the dividing wall of Circumcision by fulfilling Torah. No\nlonger do
    the people of God need to be circumcized into the covenant (we have\nbaptism),

    note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">5</p>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s carefully read
    Ephesians 4:1-3 How can humility, gentleness,\npatience, and love help maintain
    the unity Jesus calls his followers to?\nWhat happens to unity when one of these
    virtues is missing?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Ephesians
    4:1-3</p>\n<p>1Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a
    manner\nworthy of the calling with which you have been called, 2with all humility\nand
    gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,\n3being
    diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</p>\n</div>\n<p>These
    things don't just help maintain unity - they are the postures of life\nJesus builds
    his Kingdom around (second to himself I suppose). Jesus levels the\nplaying field
    for all people, and no one has anymore right to anything than\nanyone else. Things
    like humility (right view of oneself), gentleness,\npatience, love, etc. are necessary
    for Jesus' kingdom to look how he wants it\nto look</p>\n\n        </section>\n

    His shoulders; And His name will be\ncalled Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal
    Father, Prince of Peace.\n7There will be no end to the increase of His government
    or of peace, On the\nthrone of David and over his kingdom, To establish it and
    to uphold it with\njustice and righteousness From then on and forevermore. The
    zeal of the\nLord of hosts will accomplish this.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Words that stick
    out:\n- child\n- given to us\n- government will rest\n- no end to the increase\n-
    zeal...will accomplish this</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">2</p>\n<p>The
    prophet Isaiah looked forward to the arrival of the Prince of Peace, whose\nreign
    would lead to eternal shalom. Jesus\u2019 arrival fulfilled Isaiah\u2019s words.\nRead
    and reflect on Luke 2:9-15 as a group. Why do you think God announced the\nKing\u2019s
    arrival to no-name shepherds? What does this tell you about the nature\nof God
    and his Kingdom?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Luke
    2:9-15</p>\n<p>9And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory
    of the\nLord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened. 10But the angel\nsaid
    to them, \u201CDo not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great\njoy
    which will be for all the people; 11for today in the city of David\nthere has
    been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 12This will\nbe a sign for
    you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a\nmanger.\u201D 13And
    suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the\nheavenly host praising
    God and saying,</p>\n<p>14\u201CGlory to God in the highest,</p>\n<p>And on earth
    peace among men with whom He is pleased.\u201D</p>\n<p>15When the angels had gone
    away from them into heaven, the shepherds began\nsaying to one another, \u201CLet
    us go straight to Bethlehem then, and see this\nthing that has happened which
    the Lord has made known to us.\u201D</p>\n</div>\n<p>At thsi point it seems obvious
    that the reason God came to the undesirable\ncompany of teh time was to illustrate
    that the Kingdom of Heaven was to be an\nupside down kingdom. Status and power
    are hinderences under Jesus' reign, so he\nbuilds his kingdom (from our perspective)
    from the ground up.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">3</p>\n<p>The
    biblical story shows how humanity often chooses a way of life apart\nfrom God
    and suffers as a result. According to Colossians 1:19-23 , what\ndid God want
    to do to remedy this pain, and how did he accomplish his\ndesire through Jesus?</p>\n</div>\n<div
    class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Scripture</p>\n<p>Colossians
    1:19-23</p>\n<p>19For it was the Father\u2019s good pleasure for all the fullness
    to dwell in\nHim, 20and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having
    made\npeace (\u03B5\u1F30\u03C1\u03B7\u03BD\u03BF\u03C0\u03BF\u03B9\u03AD\u03C9)
    through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things on\nearth or
    things in heaven.</p>\n<p>21And although you were formerly alienated and hostile
    in mind, engaged in\nevil deeds, 22yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly
    body through\ndeath, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and
    beyond\nreproach\u2014 23if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established
    and\nsteadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have\nheard,
    which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I,\nPaul, was
    made a minister.</p>\n</div>\n<p>God interacted with Creation as a created being
    himself, holding back\n<em>something</em> in the person of Jesus. On our turf,
    God showed up to revive our\nlifeless souls and call us to live as citizens in
    his kingdom.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">4</p>\n<p>Jesus
    offers his peace to all people as a gift. Read Ephesians 2:11-16 .\nHow did Jesus
    make peace between two sharply divided people groups (Jews\nand Gentiles), and
    why did he do it (see Eph. 2:16)?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Ephesians 2:11-16</p>\n</div>\n<pre><code>11Therefore
    remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are\ncalled \u201CUncircumcision\u201D
    by the so-called \u201CCircumcision,\u201D which is performed\nin the flesh by
    human hands\u2014 12remember that you were at that time separate\nfrom Christ,
    excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the\ncovenants of promise,
    having no hope and without God in the world. 13But\nnow in Christ Jesus you who
    formerly were far off have been brought near by\nthe blood of Christ. 14For He
    Himself is our peace, who made both groups\ninto one and broke down the barrier
    of the dividing wall, 15by abolishing\nin His flesh the enmity, which is the Law
    of commandments contained in\nordinances, so that in Himself He might make the
    two into one new man, thus\nestablishing peace, \n\n16and might reconcile them
    both in one body to God\nthrough the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Jesus
    broke down the dividing wall of Circumcision by fulfilling Torah. No\nlonger do
    the people of God need to be circumcized into the covenant (we have\nbaptism),
    and no longer are God's people separate from the world via outward\nappearances
    but instead by living lives loyal to a different God - to Yahweh</p>\n<div class=\"admonition
    success\">\n<p>Jesus &quot;put to death the enmity&quot; by removing all <em>spiritually/covenantally
    relevant</em> barriers that separated Jews from Gentiles</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition
    note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">5</p>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s carefully read
    Ephesians 4:1-3 How can humility, gentleness,\npatience, and love help maintain
    the unity Jesus calls his followers to?\nWhat happens to unity when one of these
    virtues is missing?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Ephesians
    4:1-3</p>\n<p>1Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a
    manner\nworthy of the calling with which you have been called, 2with all humility\nand
    gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,\n3being
    diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</p>\n</div>\n<p>These
    things don't just help maintain unity - they are the postures of life\nJesus builds
    his Kingdom around (second to himself I suppose). Jesus levels the\nplaying field
    for all people, and no one has anymore right to anything than\nanyone else. Things
    like humility (right view of oneself), gentleness,\npatience, love, etc. are necessary
    for Jesus' kingdom to look how he wants it\nto look</p>\n\n        </section>\n

# Peace 

!!! note ""

    generally means absnese of war

In Hebrew the word is `Shalom` (Greek: Eirene). Basic biblical meeting of
Shalom is "complete" or "whole". ie. a stone with no cracks, or stone wall with
nogaps or missing grips

References a complex situation with nothing missing

Shalom can refer to a person's well-being... Life is complex and when anything
is out of alignment our Shalom breaks down and needs to be restored

To bring shalom is to make complete or restore

In Proverbs, to reconcile a broken relationship is to make shalom

## Isaiah


!!! scripture "Isaiah 9:6-7"


    6 For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us;
    And the government will rest on His shoulders;
    And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
    Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.
    7 There will be no end to the increase of His government or of peace,
    On the throne of David and over his kingdom,
    To establish it and to uphold it with justice and righteousness
    From then on and forevermore.
    The zeal of the Lord of hosts will accomplish this. 

## Jesus

Jesus restores the broken relationship between humans and our creator.

    Him, 20and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made
    peace (εἰρηνοποιέω) through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things on
    earth or things in heaven.

    21And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in
    evil deeds, 22yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through
    death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond
    reproach— 23if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and
    steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have
    heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I,
    Paul, was made a minister.

God interacted with Creation as a created being himself, holding back
_something_ in the person of Jesus. On our turf, God showed up to revive our
lifeless souls and call us to live as citizens in his kingdom.

    Jesus offers his peace to all people as a gift. Read Ephesians 2:11-16 .
    How did Jesus make peace between two sharply divided people groups (Jews
    and Gentiles), and why did he do it (see Eph. 2:16)?

!!! scripture "Ephesians 2:11-16"


    11Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are
    called “Uncircumcision” by the so-called “Circumcision,” which is performed
    in the flesh by human hands— 12remember that you were at that time separate
    from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the
    covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 13But
    now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by
    the blood of Christ. 14For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups
    into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, 15by abolishing
    in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in
    ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus
    establishing peace, 

    16and might reconcile them both in one body to God
    through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.

Jesus broke down the dividing wall of Circumcision by fulfilling Torah. No
longer do the people of God need to be circumcized into the covenant (we have
baptism), and no longer are God's people separate from the world via outward
appearances but instead by living lives loyal to a different God - to Yahweh

    Jesus "put to death the enmity" by removing all *spiritually/covenantally relevant* barriers that separated Jews from Gentiles

    Now, let’s carefully read Ephesians 4:1-3 How can humility, gentleness,
    patience, and love help maintain the unity Jesus calls his followers to?
    What happens to unity when one of these virtues is missing?

!!! scripture "Ephesians 4:1-3"

    1Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner
    worthy of the calling with which you have been called, 2with all humility
    and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,
    3being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.

These things don't just help maintain unity - they are the postures of life
Jesus builds his Kingdom around (second to himself I suppose). Jesus levels the
playing field for all people, and no one has anymore right to anything than
anyone else. Things like humility (right view of oneself), gentleness,
patience, love, etc. are necessary for Jesus' kingdom to look how he wants it
to look
