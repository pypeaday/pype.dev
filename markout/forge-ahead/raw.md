Yesterday's [[reflection-contentment-and-work]] has a second-part this morning.
As I was wrapping up a project I didn't realize the closed-off-ness of
leaving... I handed in some notes, and mid-message to someone the clock struck
midnight and I was locked out. It's fitting to be honest, and now in the wake
of yesterday's contentment post, experiencing some more loss than I expected,
today we forge ahead.

My main focus for work now is a project I will refer to as `forge`. It is what
I will bring to Caterpillar Autonomy but I can only build it thanks to the
gifts and experience God has given me. The thing I want to put on paper is a
short list of experiences I think God in his sovereignty, gave me over the last
few years and what they provide for me for Forge.

## Cat Reman Platform

One of the first things that comes to mind is another project I was sad to
lose: a platform I started for an analytics team in Cat Reman. That began as a
simple python cli to automate some developer operations that was otherwise a
dozen clicks through the AWS console. Using [boto3] and some simple python I
gave that team the start of some real velocity gains. Eventually that grew into
a larger kubernetes-based service where the data science operations: code quality,
deployment, updates, webapps, etc. were all handled by our platform. It wasn't
perfect, it wasn't self-contained, it was a set of things kind of glued
together with systems and scripts, but it worked, it works today and is under
fantastic ownership.

What I learned just from starting that cli was to be passionate about solving
problems. No one asked me to make it, but it needed made, and the team is in
such a better place for me having started it.

## Kedro and OpenShift

Another short project I was able to participate in a few years ago was leading
a data-syncronization task into a fiery horrific crash that lasted weeks -
neigh months longer - than was necessary or appropriate... The details aren't
relevant - I was the lead dev in a new place tasks with syncing up data between
2 applications. Ultimately, could've been a python script but I over-designed a
kedro-based solution because of some requirements I misunderstood. Part of that
misunderstanding was not knowing how to get the requirements I needed, but they
weren't provided in full, I didn't know any better, so for weeks we were a
corporate meme trying to use python to update a database that no one on our
team understood if we were allowed to write to.... It was very confusing.

But what I learned was a lot about gathering requirements, questioning
assumptions, and the importance of understanding your constraints as fully as
possible as early as possible.

## A Real Platform

Then one of the biggest blessings I see for Forge, is the experience I've
gotten recently with AWS at scale... Not 1 or 2 services created with
Medium.com copy pasta tutorials from docs... but experience working in a large
project across many accounts, supporting several teams, using a wide variety of
technologies from Terraform to Kubernetes.

On this project I learned about practical system design and gained a lot of
confidence in supporting systems that are complicated... I'm not the smartest
guy in the world but I'm no dummy, and even while lacking fluency in the system
I was supporting on this project I learned a lot of troubleshooting skills and
gained confidence in my ability to troubleshoot complex systems.

I'll need this for Forge - which will break certainly, but I'll be there to fix
it and I'm sure I can because I've done these other things.

## Fin

The Lord has been with me through these projects - he has certainly blessed me
with a skillset and personality that lends itself to being really useful in the
Tech world I've landed in (which is a whole 'nother story of God's sovereignty
and provision). I am very grateful for the swath of experience I've gotten over
the last 8 years or so, and this season I'm in of change is rocking me a little
more than I anticipated but by God's grace I think I see the purpose, or at
least **a** purpose, and I pray I am making the choices for work he wants me to
make.
