<p>This verse showing up in Spurgeon's <strong>Morning and Evening</strong> is a divine
grace to me. Today is a significant day in a journey God has had me on towards
contentment. The circumstances of that journey, the specifics, are known to
some but I can still speak generally enough about it in this reflection because
the generalities are not unique to me - anymore than the requirement to
<strong>learn</strong> contentment, for it's not a natural state for a man.</p>
<p>For me, like a lot of others, it's about money right now. Over the last few
years I've been able to make a pretty significant income and God has blessed me
through the work I've done, but something I have noticed is the work itself has
felt less and less blessed, and more like a burden as the goal became money. I want
to be a billionaire and never concern myself with a financial struggle - but
this is childish thinking. The last few years have shown me that I can work, a
lot, and make money, also a lot (relatively speaking). I don't feel as though
I've wasted time necessarily, the <em>amount</em> of work and the <em>time</em> the work
takes are different things. But where I may have recovered some of the time in
overworking, I certainly gave up other things: fulfilment and excellence to
name the top 2. As I've not been content, and have striven for more it's become
clear that <strong>wanting more</strong> is itself a burden.</p>
<p>Today marks the end of some income that I've been able to work for - not all of
it, I'm extremely blessed in <a class="wikilink" href="/cat-autonomy-2-0">cat-autonomy-2-0</a>. The facts are though that
through the circumstances God has brought me recently, I'll be making less than
50% of what I've been able to make over the last couple years... By God's grace
we still have more than enough, and by his grace again today is a significant
day for me to step through a doorway of contentment and officially realign my
work priorities with the worldview Jesus has called me into.</p>

<p>I have been sort of fighting off a belief that I'm on a literal mission from
God in Caterpillar Autonomy... If someone could see my inner-monologue play out
they'd certainly get Blues Brothers vibes...</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/pypeaday/images.pype.dev@main/blog-media/On%20A%20Mission%20From%20God%20%5BMKZSqd5Y8nA%5D.gif" alt="On A Mission From God.mp4" /></p>
<p>I hope I'm not just reaching for some grand facetious meaning for the work I'm
now doing to distract myself from the changes coming to my paycheck. It really
feels to me like God has prepared me in many ways for the work that's in front
me. I'm thankful for that preparation and now it seems like it's time to give
up the desires for riches and focus on doing something more than closing
tickets and supporting a small team of people.</p>
<p>As God calls me to contentment in my personal life, I think he's also planning
on blessing the work I'm doing. Earlier I said I have been very blessed by the
work I have been able to do, but I don't know that God has blessed
the work itself - much of what I've done was filled with mistakes you only
learn by doing something the first time... Certainly in some ways he has
blessed those things, but I see something &quot;just bigger&quot; in Cat Autonomy, and I
think I'm here to play a real role in it</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p class="admonition-title">maybe like Joseph in Egypt</p>
<p>like I said - literal mission from God</p>
</div>
<p>I've had to give-up some pay to play that role, but the Lord has taught (and is
teaching) me that there's much more to work than a paycheck, more to life than money.</p>
<p>It is easy, very easy, for me to roll out of this line-of-thinking, I've done
it several times even while writing this... but I am sure contentment is
something the Lord has for me. Today's significance is just a temporal
milestone, a date that was approaching at a constant rate of change... The day
is here, today's meditation is on contentment, and the Lord is doing a work in
and through me. Amen.</p>
