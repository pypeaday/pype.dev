content: "1 John 3: 7-10 for men's group in August 2025\n\n???+ note \"1 John 3: 7-10\"\n\n
  \   7\_Little children, let no one deceive you: the one who practices\n    righteousness
  is righteous, just as that one is righteous. 8\_The one who\n    practices sin is
  of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the\n    beginning. For this
  reason the Son of God was revealed: in order to destroy the\n    works of the devil.
  9\_Everyone who is fathered by God does not practice sin,\n    because his seed
  resides in him, and he is not able to sin, because he has been\n    fathered by
  God. 10\_By this the children of God and the children of the devil\n    are evident:
  everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God,\n    namely, the one
  who does not love his brother.\n\n???+ note \"verse 7 from ESV\"\n\n    7\_Little
  children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous,
  as he is righteous\n\nThe difference I note is that ESV, right or wrong, is more
  clear that the \"just as that one is righteous\" is actually Jesus\n\n## Flowchart\n\n[affine
  link](https://affine.paynepride.com/workspace/068b2d03-00ee-4b4b-9a8d-d7b98e85f1f2/YYJT5gEfZin3nTFv7s5wp)\n\n##
  Interesting notes\n\n- we will avoid cheap questions that assume black and white
  understanding of\nthe passage \"the one who practices sin if of the devil\" does
  not mean that\nsinning one time means you're not saved... put the juvenile things
  behind us\n- \"the devil has been sinning from the beginning\"\n  - from the beginning
  of what?\n  - has he really been sinning the entire time? don't we have mythology
  about\n  Lucifer being an angel of light??? (note the heavy sarcasm from me here...)\n\n##
  Reflection\n\nI've been loosely mediating on this and Romans 7 and 8\n\n??? note
  \"Romans 7:16-8:11\"\n\n    15 For what I am doing I do not understand, because
  what I want to do, this I do not practice, but what I hate, this I do. \n    16
  Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good. 17 So now
  it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. 18 For I know that nothing
  good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. \n    For I have the desire to do what
  is right, but not the ability to carry it out. 19 For I do not do the good I want,
  but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. 20 Now if I do what I do not
  want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. \n    21 So I
  find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. 22 For
  I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, 23 but I see in my members another
  law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin
  that dwells in my members. \n    24 Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me
  from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then,
  I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of
  sin. 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
  \n    2 For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from
  the law of sin and death. 3 For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh,
  could not do. \n    By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for
  sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, 4 in order that the righteous requirement of
  the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according
  to the Spirit. \n    5 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds
  on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their
  minds on the things of the Spirit. 6 For to set the mind on the flesh is death,
  but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. \n    7 For the mind that is
  set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God\u2019s law; indeed,
  it cannot. \n    8 Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. \n    9 You, however,
  are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you.
  Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. \n    10 But
  if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life
  because of righteousness. 11 If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead
  dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your
  mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.\n\nI think I'm mostly walking
  away from these texts with 2 things on my heart:\n\n1. I must be desensitized to
  some sin in my life - I think it's impossible for\n   me to know in my inner being
  am I genuinely separating myself from my\nsinfulness and enjoying God's presence,
  or am I using grace as an excuse to\nsin... The entanglement of my own heart is
  one of the most difficult things to\nnavigate in personal faith.\n2. I am questioning
  my devotion... am I devoted to Jesus, to his law, to doing\n   good... or am I a
  slave to myself?\n\nAs I write this out, the Christian concept of \"setting the
  captives free\" and\njubilee and freedom strike my heart deeply. Just these phrases
  begin to call up\nemotions. But as I look at my life right now, what am I doing
  that shouts\nfreedom? I spend more time lately playing games than being entrenched
  in\ntheological study, I think about work more than things which are noble and\npraiseworthy,
  and I seem to purposefully focus on my own situations internally\nrather than on
  God's grace (which I do externally a lot - but I feel this\ntension inside - __a
  hook of doubt__)\n\n??? danger \"Romans 8:5a\"\n\n    5 For those who live according
  to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, \n\n??? note \"Romans 6\"\n\n
  \   6 For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit
  is life and peace.\n\nWhy would I be hesitant to regularly set my mind on things
  of the spirit? I\nabsolutely feel something inside that rebels against the things
  of God at\ntimes... at odd times as well.\n\n## A Prayer\n\nLord Jesus, help me
  to set my mind on things of the Spirit - to live in\naccordance with your will and
  righteousness. I confess I run in ways I think\nare secret or hidden, I reject godly
  things daily, and yet in your\ncompassionate love you have saved me from this body
  of sin and death. Praise be\nto God, guide my heart and mind today, just enough
  so that tomorrow I can ask\nfor what I need for the day\n\n!!! note \"Romans 8:21-25\"\n\n
  \   21\_Consequently, I find the principle with me, the one who wants to do good,
  that evil is present with me. 22\_For I joyfully agree with the law of God in my
  inner person, 23\_but I observe another law in my members, at war with the law of
  my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that exists in my members. 24\_Wretched
  man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 25\_Thanks be to God
  through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself with my mind am enslaved to the
  law of God, but with my flesh I am enslaved to the law of sin."

    deceive you: the one who practices\nrighteousness is righteous, just as that one
    is righteous. 8\_The one who\npractices sin is of the devil, because the devil
    has been sinning from the\nbeginning. For this reason the Son of God was revealed:
    in order to destroy the\nworks of the devil. 9\_Everyone who is fathered by God
    does not practice sin,\nbecause his seed resides in him, and he is not able to
    sin, because he has been\nfathered by God. 10\_By this the children of God and
    the children of the devil\nare evident: everyone who does not practice righteousness
    is not of God,\nnamely, the one who does not love his brother.</p>\n</div>\n<div

    on this and Romans 7 and 8</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note is-collapsible collapsible-closed\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Romans 7:16-8:11</p>\n<p>15 For what I am doing I do
    not understand, because what I want to do, this I do not practice, but what I
    hate, this I do.\n16 Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that
    it is good. 17 So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within
    me. 18 For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh.\nFor I
    have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. 19 For
    I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.
    20 Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells
    within me.\n21 So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies
    close at hand. 22 For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, 23 but I
    see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making
    me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.\n24 Wretched man that
    I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God through
    Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but
    with my flesh I serve the law of sin. 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation
    for those who are in Christ Jesus.\n2 For the law of the Spirit of life has set
    you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. 3 For God has done what
    the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do.\nBy sending his own Son in the likeness
    of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, 4 in order that the
    righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according
    to the flesh but according to the Spirit.\n5 For those who live according to the
    flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according
    to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. 6 For to set the mind
    on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.\n7
    For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit
    to God\u2019s law; indeed, it cannot.\n8 Those who are in the flesh cannot please
    God.\n9 You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit
    of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong
    to him.\n10 But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin,
    the Spirit is life because of righteousness. 11 If the Spirit of him who raised
    Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will
    also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.</p>\n</div>\n<p>I
    think I'm mostly walking away from these texts with 2 things on my heart:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I
    must be desensitized to some sin in my life - I think it's impossible for\nme
    to know in my inner being am I genuinely separating myself from my\nsinfulness
    and enjoying God's presence, or am I using grace as an excuse to\nsin... The entanglement
    of my own heart is one of the most difficult things to\nnavigate in personal faith.</li>\n<li>I
    am questioning my devotion... am I devoted to Jesus, to his law, to doing\ngood...
    or am I a slave to myself?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As I write this out, the Christian
    concept of &quot;setting the captives free&quot; and\njubilee and freedom strike
    my heart deeply. Just these phrases begin to call up\nemotions. But as I look
    at my life right now, what am I doing that shouts\nfreedom? I spend more time
    lately playing games than being entrenched in\ntheological study, I think about
    work more than things which are noble and\npraiseworthy, and I seem to purposefully
    focus on my own situations internally\nrather than on God's grace (which I do
    externally a lot - but I feel this\ntension inside - <strong>a hook of doubt</strong>)</p>\n<div

    is righteous. 8\_The one who\npractices sin is of the devil, because the devil
    has been sinning from the\nbeginning. For this reason the Son of God was revealed:
    in order to destroy the\nworks of the devil. 9\_Everyone who is fathered by God
    does not practice sin,\nbecause his seed resides in him, and he is not able to
    sin, because he has been\nfathered by God. 10\_By this the children of God and
    the children of the devil\nare evident: everyone who does not practice righteousness

    on this and Romans 7 and 8</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note is-collapsible collapsible-closed\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Romans 7:16-8:11</p>\n<p>15 For what I am doing I do
    not understand, because what I want to do, this I do not practice, but what I
    hate, this I do.\n16 Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that
    it is good. 17 So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within
    me. 18 For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh.\nFor I
    have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. 19 For
    I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.
    20 Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells
    within me.\n21 So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies
    close at hand. 22 For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, 23 but I
    see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making
    me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.\n24 Wretched man that
    I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God through
    Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but
    with my flesh I serve the law of sin. 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation
    for those who are in Christ Jesus.\n2 For the law of the Spirit of life has set
    you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. 3 For God has done what
    the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do.\nBy sending his own Son in the likeness
    of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, 4 in order that the
    righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according
    to the flesh but according to the Spirit.\n5 For those who live according to the
    flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according
    to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. 6 For to set the mind
    on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.\n7
    For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit
    to God\u2019s law; indeed, it cannot.\n8 Those who are in the flesh cannot please
    God.\n9 You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit
    of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong
    to him.\n10 But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin,
    the Spirit is life because of righteousness. 11 If the Spirit of him who raised
    Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will
    also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.</p>\n</div>\n<p>I
    think I'm mostly walking away from these texts with 2 things on my heart:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I
    must be desensitized to some sin in my life - I think it's impossible for\nme
    to know in my inner being am I genuinely separating myself from my\nsinfulness
    and enjoying God's presence, or am I using grace as an excuse to\nsin... The entanglement
    of my own heart is one of the most difficult things to\nnavigate in personal faith.</li>\n<li>I
    am questioning my devotion... am I devoted to Jesus, to his law, to doing\ngood...
    or am I a slave to myself?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As I write this out, the Christian
    concept of &quot;setting the captives free&quot; and\njubilee and freedom strike
    my heart deeply. Just these phrases begin to call up\nemotions. But as I look
    at my life right now, what am I doing that shouts\nfreedom? I spend more time
    lately playing games than being entrenched in\ntheological study, I think about
    work more than things which are noble and\npraiseworthy, and I seem to purposefully
    focus on my own situations internally\nrather than on God's grace (which I do
    externally a lot - but I feel this\ntension inside - <strong>a hook of doubt</strong>)</p>\n<div

    to set my mind on things of the Spirit - to live in\naccordance with your will
    and righteousness. I confess I run in ways I think\nare secret or hidden, I reject
    godly things daily, and yet in your\ncompassionate love you have saved me from
    this body of sin and death. Praise be\nto God, guide my heart and mind today,
    just enough so that tomorrow I can ask\nfor what I need for the day</p>\n<div

    I find the principle with me, the one who wants to do good, that evil is present
    with me. 22\_For I joyfully agree with the law of God in my inner person, 23\_but
    I observe another law in my members, at war with the law of my mind and making
    me captive to the law of sin that exists in my members. 24\_Wretched man that
    I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 25\_Thanks be to God through
    Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself with my mind am enslaved to the law of
    God, but with my flesh I am enslaved to the law of sin.</p>\n</div>\n\n        </section>\n

    class=\"admonition-title\">Romans 7:16-8:11</p>\n<p>15 For what I am doing I do
    not understand, because what I want to do, this I do not practice, but what I
    hate, this I do.\n16 Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that
    it is good. 17 So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within
    me. 18 For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh.\nFor I
    have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. 19 For
    I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.
    20 Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells
    within me.\n21 So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies
    close at hand. 22 For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, 23 but I
    see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making
    me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.\n24 Wretched man that
    I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God through
    Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but
    with my flesh I serve the law of sin. 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation
    for those who are in Christ Jesus.\n2 For the law of the Spirit of life has set
    you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. 3 For God has done what
    the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do.\nBy sending his own Son in the likeness
    of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, 4 in order that the
    righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according
    to the flesh but according to the Spirit.\n5 For those who live according to the
    flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according
    to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. 6 For to set the mind
    on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.\n7
    For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit
    to God\u2019s law; indeed, it cannot.\n8 Those who are in the flesh cannot please
    God.\n9 You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit
    of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong
    to him.\n10 But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin,
    the Spirit is life because of righteousness. 11 If the Spirit of him who raised
    Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will
    also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.</p>\n</div>\n<p>I

1 John 3: 7-10 for men's group in August 2025

???+ note "1 John 3: 7-10"

    7 Little children, let no one deceive you: the one who practices
    righteousness is righteous, just as that one is righteous. 8 The one who
    practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the
    beginning. For this reason the Son of God was revealed: in order to destroy the
    works of the devil. 9 Everyone who is fathered by God does not practice sin,
    because his seed resides in him, and he is not able to sin, because he has been
    fathered by God. 10 By this the children of God and the children of the devil
    are evident: everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God,
    namely, the one who does not love his brother.

???+ note "verse 7 from ESV"

    7 Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous

The difference I note is that ESV, right or wrong, is more clear that the "just as that one is righteous" is actually Jesus

## Interesting notes

- we will avoid cheap questions that assume black and white understanding of
the passage "the one who practices sin if of the devil" does not mean that
sinning one time means you're not saved... put the juvenile things behind us
- "the devil has been sinning from the beginning"
  - from the beginning of what?
  - has he really been sinning the entire time? don't we have mythology about
  Lucifer being an angel of light??? (note the heavy sarcasm from me here...)

## Reflection

I've been loosely mediating on this and Romans 7 and 8

??? note "Romans 7:16-8:11"

    15 For what I am doing I do not understand, because what I want to do, this I do not practice, but what I hate, this I do. 
    16 Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good. 17 So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. 18 For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. 
    For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. 19 For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. 20 Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. 
    21 So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. 22 For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being, 23 but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. 
    24 Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin. 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. 
    2 For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. 3 For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. 
    By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, 4 in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. 
    5 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit. 6 For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace. 
    7 For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God’s law; indeed, it cannot. 
    8 Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. 
    9 You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him. 
    10 But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness. 11 If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.

I think I'm mostly walking away from these texts with 2 things on my heart:

1. I must be desensitized to some sin in my life - I think it's impossible for
   me to know in my inner being am I genuinely separating myself from my
sinfulness and enjoying God's presence, or am I using grace as an excuse to
sin... The entanglement of my own heart is one of the most difficult things to
navigate in personal faith.
2. I am questioning my devotion... am I devoted to Jesus, to his law, to doing
   good... or am I a slave to myself?

As I write this out, the Christian concept of "setting the captives free" and
jubilee and freedom strike my heart deeply. Just these phrases begin to call up
emotions. But as I look at my life right now, what am I doing that shouts
freedom? I spend more time lately playing games than being entrenched in
theological study, I think about work more than things which are noble and
praiseworthy, and I seem to purposefully focus on my own situations internally
rather than on God's grace (which I do externally a lot - but I feel this
tension inside - __a hook of doubt__)

??? danger "Romans 8:5a"

    5 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, 

??? note "Romans 6"

    6 For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.

Why would I be hesitant to regularly set my mind on things of the spirit? I
absolutely feel something inside that rebels against the things of God at
times... at odd times as well.

## A Prayer

Lord Jesus, help me to set my mind on things of the Spirit - to live in
accordance with your will and righteousness. I confess I run in ways I think
are secret or hidden, I reject godly things daily, and yet in your
compassionate love you have saved me from this body of sin and death. Praise be
to God, guide my heart and mind today, just enough so that tomorrow I can ask
for what I need for the day

!!! note "Romans 8:21-25"

    21 Consequently, I find the principle with me, the one who wants to do good, that evil is present with me. 22 For I joyfully agree with the law of God in my inner person, 23 but I observe another law in my members, at war with the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that exists in my members. 24 Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself with my mind am enslaved to the law of God, but with my flesh I am enslaved to the law of sin.
