!!! note "Isaiah 9:6-7"

    6 For a child has been born for us;  a son has been given to us.  And the dominion will be on his shoulder,  and his name is called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,  Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.  7 His dominion will grow continually,  and to peace there will be no end  on the throne of David and over his kingdom,  to establish it and sustain it  with justice and righteousness  now and forever.  The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will do this.

## To Peace There Will Be No End

What a fantastic promise about what the King will do - to bring unending peace.
I wrote about peace during Advent last year - [[advent-2024-peace]]

> Things are as they are supposed to be

What King Jesus will bring is a kingdom where every relationship is _as it is
supposed to be_.

There is something amazing and relieving about reconciling with a friend.
Brokenness is everywhere, and that affects our relationship with everyone, from
the best friend to the 3rd cousin of your boss's secretary. The closer you are,
the more impactful the brokenness can be, the worse the pain in the
relationship can feel, but also the more glorious and cheerful it is when
things go from bad to _as they should be_
