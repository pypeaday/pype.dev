<p>God creates Eden in which he places humans to be his royal image - priests. God
sets humans up to receive his blessing but humans choose their own way. The
promise is for a priest and a sacrifice to come in Jesus.</p>
<p>God chooses Abraham and Sarah as the first royal priesthood as they are chosen
by God to bless all the nations.</p>

<p>A priestly king of Salem. Melchizedek recognizes Yahweh as the God of gods -
Abraham tithes to him and that's about the end of the story</p>
<p>Salem is ancient short name for Jerusalem.
Abraham's tithe to Melchizedek is just like the Israelite call to tithe to the
Levites (priests) to support them.</p>

<p>Abraham and Sarah are promised their own children but they take amtters into
their own hands by scheming with Hagar. Eventually Sarah is given her own son,
Issac, who God then calls for his life as a test of Abraham - it represents God
challenging Abraham to trust him with his own promise, and to not go his own
way with Sarah</p>
<p>DUring the Isaac sacrifice narrative a ram is given in place and Abraham names the place &quot;God will provide&quot;.</p>

<p>The story of God's call to sacrifice Isaac is much like the story of Abraham
meeting Melchizedek. In the Melchizedek story Abraham meets a priest on a high
place and gives him an offering. In the Isaac story Abraham acts as the priest
and a ram is given to him by the LORD that covers the sins of Abraham's family.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Atonement and Covering</p>
<p>Covering the sin in this case looks much more like redemption and resolve
rather than payment for gult, similar to a small-scale apology can cover a
grievance even though no payment is made to make anything 'right', the

<p>Shalem, or Salem, is later known as Jerusalem. Moriah, a mountainous region in
Jerusalem, is later called the “mount of the LORD” (Genesis 22:14) and the
“temple mount” (2 Chronicles 3:1). With all of this in mind, compare Genesis
14:17-20 with Genesis 22:1-14 . How do you see God providing for Abraham in
these similar settings?</p>

<p>God’s Promise to Abram</p>
<p>17Then after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who
were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the valley of
Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley). 18And Melchizedek king of Salem
brought out bread and wine; now he was a priest of God Most High. 19He
blessed him and said,</p>
<p>“Blessed be Abram of God Most High,</p>
<p>Possessor of heaven and earth;</p>
<p>20And blessed be God Most High,</p>
<p>Who has delivered your enemies into your hand.”</p>

<p>The Offering of Isaac</p>
<p>1Now it came about after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to
him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 2He said, “Take now your son,
your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and
offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will
tell you.” 3So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey,
and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son; and he split wood
for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had
told him. 4On the third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from
a distance. 5Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey, and
I and the lad will go over there; and we will worship and return to you.”
6Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son,
and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked
on together. 7Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “My father!” And
he said, “Here I am, my son.” And he said, “Behold, the fire and the wood,
but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” 8Abraham said, “God will
provide for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” So the two of
them walked on together.</p>
<p>9Then they came to the place of which God had told
him; and Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood, and bound his
son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. 10Abraham
stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. 11But the angel
of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he
said, “Here I am.” 12He said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the
lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you
have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.” 13Then Abraham raised
his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by
his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt
offering in the place of his son. 14Abraham called the name of that place
The Lord Will Provide, as it is said to this day, “In the mount of the Lord
it will be provided.”</p>

<p>As you review Hebrews 7 , notice how the author assures their audience that
Jesus is better than any other priest. What are some of the reasons the
author provides? How is this good news for everyone?</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition scripture">
<p class="admonition-title">Hebrews 7</p>
<p>Melchizedek’s Priesthood Like Christ’s</p>
<p>1For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 2to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils, was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace. 3Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.</p>
<p>4Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils. 5And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest’s office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham. 6But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises. 7But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. 8In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives on. 9And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes, 10for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.</p>
<p>11Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated according to the order of Aaron? 12For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also. 13For the one concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar. 14For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. 15And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek, 16who has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power of an indestructible life. 17For it is attested of Him,</p>
<p>“You are a priest forever</p>
<p>According to the order of Melchizedek.”</p>
<p>18For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness 19(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God. 20And inasmuch as it was not without an oath 21(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him,</p>
<p>“The Lord has sworn</p>
<p>And will not change His mind,</p>
<p>‘You are a priest forever’ ”);</p>
<p>22so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.</p>
<p>23The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing, 24but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently. 25Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.</p>
<p>26For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens; 27who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself. 28For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever.</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>Melchizedek was &quot;king of righteousness&quot; and &quot;kind of peace&quot;, Jesus is a priest according to &quot;the order of Melchizedek&quot; and so seems to be that Jesus is the continued reigning king of righteousness and peace</li>
<li>Melchizedek was priest of God Most High - the priestly order changed to Levi with the giving of the Law... Jesus represents, and <em>is</em>, another change in the priesthood which necessitates another change in law (verse 12). Jesus' kingship and priesthood is more similar to Melchizek's than Levi's (who was no king anyways).</li>
<li>Levitical priesthood was not bound by an oath - but Jesus' priesthood is bound by Yahweh's oath to not change his mind, Jesus is priest forever</li>
<li>Former priests, Levites, changed due to death, but Jesus persists forever (Melchizedek also presumably died)</li>
