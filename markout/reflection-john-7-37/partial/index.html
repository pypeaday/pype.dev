<p>Now on the last day of the feast—the great day—Jesus stood and cried out,
saying, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me, and let him drink,</p>

<p>So, today obviously isn't the last day of a feast Jesus is speaking at, I don't
mean to impose anything beyond a trivial relationship between &quot;the last day&quot;
and today being New Year's Eve. The reflection is for reflecting, not education
and so today I pray the Lord be good to me in meditating on this text this
morning.</p>

<p>Yahweh longs for all people to be reconciled to him. It's a fact that that
won't be the case because of the degrees of wills that can coexist even though
the mechanism of their relationship is hidden from us -
<a class="wikilink" href="/the-hidden-things-belong-to-yahweh">the-hidden-things-belong-to-yahweh</a>.</p>
<p>However, a clear truth here is that &quot;Jesus cried out&quot;. His voice goes out, loud
and all around, to all people within ear-shot - &quot;If anyone is thirsty, let him
come to me&quot;.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p>If anyone is thirsty</p>
</div>
<p>Jesus gives no qualifiers on who his message goes out to - it's the dad of 6
kids nailing it, the wife of of a businessman maintaining her home, the harlot
trying to wreck that home, the prostitute on the corner, the corrupt politician
(even Paul was called)... Jesus' voice goes out to &quot;anyone&quot;... So who am I to
think that my standing as a righteous person before God by the grace of the
blood of Jesus has anything to do with who I am? His call goes out to
<strong>anyone</strong>.</p>
<p>So what is for me today? or for the person who is reading this? I don't know...
Jesus has been so good to me, and I also want all people to know him. I want
every person to experience being freed from their sinful master, freed from
themselves. I believe that if all people gave their lives to Jesus the world
would be healed over night. That fantasy land doesnt' exist though, and Jesus'
call has gone out to anyone and everyone - but the time for that call is coming
to a close and when he comes back it'll be to redeem his own.</p>
<p>It's one thing to be invited to a wedding feast. The invitation has gone out.</p>
<p>It's another thing stand between a loving husband and his captive bride, or a
warrior father and his oppressed child. That is the position of every person
when the Lord comes back whose knee is not already bowed.</p>
<p>The New Year brings a time of reflection about life, what to start, what to
stop. Jesus has been good to my heart in this year - creating a genuine
desire for all people to experience him. I hope that anyone reading this or any
of my posts might hear God's calling through what he's done in my life.</p>
<p>His call went out to <strong>anyone</strong> but he redeems <strong>his own</strong>, may you accept
adoption today.</p>
