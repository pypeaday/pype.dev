!!! note "Ephesians 4:1-6"

    4Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord, exhort you to live in a manner
    worthy of the calling with which you were called: 2 with all humility and
    gentleness, with patience, putting up with one another in love, 3 being eager
    to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; 4 one body and one Spirit
    (just as also you were called with one hope of your calling), 5 one Lord, one
    faith, one baptism, 6 one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through
    all, and in all.

## Unity and Peace

Once again I say "Praise God" this morning for more words of Scripture that
succinctly highlight the beauty of the Gospel.

1. "I, the prisoner in the Lord..." No one knows better than Paul that if Jesus
   says "Come to me" you have no choice but to obey.
2. "with humility, gentleness, and patience put up with one another in love, be
   eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace". Christian
   community was literally the talk of the town in the early church - it was so
   odd that historians have written about "The Way" (the early early name of the
   Christian movement). Acts says believers "had all things in common". Jesus
   brings unity that transcends any differences between us.
3. "one...one...one..." Paul is saying so clearly that we are one family in
   Christa. Later in the same letter he says "be eager to do good to all, and
   especially to those in the household of faith". Christians should be meeting
   the needs of those around them, but even more so meeting the needs of our
   brothers and sisters in Christ.

I really strive for unity... My whole life people have accused me of loving an
argument (which is true) but I am not pugnacious. I do not enjoy fighting - I
do enjoy rhetoric and debate, but by God's grace I hate division. There are
several examples I can point to in my life where unity and "team spirit" was
important to me.

!!! note "Simple Example"

    I worked for Summit Ministries for several summers, eventually serving on
    some leadership positions. While in those positions I wanted to do "extra"
    things to unify our counselors, and one was that every year I'd design a
    sweatshirt that we'd all (or most of us) would buy. I just love the idea of
    being united for a common and GOOD goal.o

Christians should be the most unified and loving people on the planet...
unfortunately that isn't the case, and I know a lot of people in and out of the
Church who have experienced great disunity and division. That really is
unfortunate, but I think the only thing I can do is march forward to the beat
of the drum Jesus has for me. And one of those beats is to strive for unity
"putting up with one another in love, being eager to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace"
