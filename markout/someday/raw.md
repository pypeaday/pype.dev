## Purpose of the Page

Projects, tools, and technologies I want to explore someday. This is my queue
of things to check out, organized by category. Each item has a checkbox for
tracking progress - once explored, I'll add a summary or link to a longer post.

## Self-Hosted Services

- [x] **[Karakeep](https://docs.karakeep.app/)** (2025-07-19) Read-later and
      bookmarking service to replace texting links to myself. Want to explore the app
      and extension, set up RSS feeds for lists.

  - I am running Karakeep, would like to hook it into my blog like `thoughts` but just haven't taken the time to do it

- [ ] **[Rybbit](https://github.com/pypeaday/rybbit)** (2025-08-23)
      Self-hosted Google Analytics alternative. Forked the repo, want to try on
      quadtask.

- [ ] **[Domain Locker](https://github.com/lissy93/domain-locker)**
      (2025-12-09) Domain monitoring service. Stood it up and want to see how it
      fits into the lab over the next year.

## Platform & DevOps

- [ ] **[Komodo](https://github.com/pypeaday/komodo)** (2025-08-23)
      Platform-as-a-product tool that aligns with my vision for "platform as a
      product". Discovered it matches much of what I envisioned.

- [x] **[IronCalc](https://github.com/ironcalc/IronCalc)** (2025-11-07)
      Self-hosted spreadsheet solution. Need to manage the build, starting to think
      about a reusable Forgejo action for Docker builds.

  - Unfortunately there's not much to write about - neat project but I don't need it

- [ ] **[LLDAP](https://github.com/lldap/lldap/blob/main/docs/install.md#with-docker)**
      (2025-11-10) Lightweight LDAP for homelab SSO. Want to get SSO setup at home
      for repoflow, considering LLDAP and Authelia for authentication.

- [ ] **Repoflow** (2025-08-09) Artifactory replacement for artifact storage.
      Requested a free license and experimenting with it for homelab platform
      storage.
  - _Note: Have blog posts but no dedicated project/glossary page yet_

## Storage Solutions

- [ ] **[Garage](https://git.deuxfleurs.fr/Deuxfleurs/garage)** (2026-02-15)
      Distributed object storage. MinIO is archived, so looking at Garage as a
      replacement for object storage.

- [ ] **[RustFS](https://github.com/rustfs/rustfs)** (2026-02-15) MinIO
      alternative in Rust. Alternative to MinIO being considered alongside Garage.

---

## Mobile & Apps

- [ ] **[Conduit](https://github.com/cogwheel0/conduit)** (2025-08-23)
      Open-WebUI Android app. Found it but needs to build and sideload the APK.

---

## Desktop & Window Management

- [x] **[AeroSpace](https://github.com/nikitabobko/AeroSpace)** (2025-11-26)
      Tiling window manager for Mac. Want to try it out for window management.

  - I am using AeroSpace on my Mac - it's beautiful

- [ ] **[Fluid Tile](https://codeberg.org/Serroda/fluid-tile)** (2025-11-26)
      Tiling window manager option. Saw it as a tiling window manager option to try
      after getting tiling working on Mac with AeroSpace.

---

## Productivity & Utilities

- [ ] **[ChoresRewards](https://github.com/matda59/ChoresRewards)**
      (2025-08-10) Chore tracking with rewards for kids. Looking for a way to track
      and reward chores for both myself and the kids; considering rewriting it in
      FastAPI if the auth mechanisms don't work out.

- [ ] **[Lazyjournal](https://github.com/Lifailon/lazyjournal)** (2025-11-15)
      TUI for host logs. Lazydocker/git-inspired tool for viewing host logs that I
      learned about.

- [ ] **[Oh My Opencode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode)**
      (2025-12-31) Compare with OpenAgents. Need to compare OpenAgents with
      oh-my-opencode.

- [ ] **[Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy)** (2026-02-03) STT tool for
      voice control. Started using for speech-to-text on work Mac to talk to neovim
      and opencode; excited to explore vocally conversing with agents.
