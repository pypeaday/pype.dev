## Today

- started another mcp server with opencode for sermon editing with church... feels so simple that an agent should be able to do it
- opencode also implementing quadtask v2 as a notifiq app

## Bugs

- zensical builds are broken in forgejo, maybe it's the runner image I'm using so might need to update it?
  - having an image at home with just, zensical, uv, etc. built in already would be appropriate
