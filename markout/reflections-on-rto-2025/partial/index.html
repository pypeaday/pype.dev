<p>I gave Cat a lot over the years... time and energy mostly. It was a good
relationship. In 8 years I had &quot;exceeded expectations&quot; 5 times, &quot;meets
expectations&quot; twice, and one year I got a &quot;superior&quot;. This is corpo-jargon
bullshit speak for &quot;I'm a highly valued resource&quot;. And throughout that time I
felt appreciated for what I gave. The situations I was put in at Cat forced me
to grow in many uncomfortable ways all at once, but I received dense experience
in a lot of areas of professional life and technology, and that has paid
dividends.</p>
<p>At Cat I felt seen most of the time (save for one of those &quot;meets
expectations&quot; years but that's not the point right now...). I received an award
for some work I began doing in reman that became the rada platform... if you're
reading this than you at least heard about it in the parent post.</p>
<p>So in some significant ways, Cat also gave back to me.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">embarrasment</p>
<p>But one thing I gave Cat that I'm embarrased by, is trust.</p>
</div>
<p>I was told a position would be made remote so I could take it, I moved away, took the
position, and killed it. I believed Caterpillar would fulfil its end of the
bargain - I meet (or exceed) expectations in a remote role, I can live the life
I build in that remote place... but that's apparently not the case, and I'm hurting over
being so cast aside...</p>
<p>Having to sit through meetings where people &quot;bleed cat
yellow&quot;, &quot;we're a cat family&quot; etc... the same bullshit you hear anywhere else
though my experience had been somewhat true to that &quot;cat family&quot; vibe... but
it's not a family, it's not even a contract - RTO shows that Cat thinks it's
ownership... there's no business case to bring my role into the office, there's
data to the contrary, but <em>to quote the head of the Reman Business Unit</em></p>

<p>&quot;It's about bringing people into the office...&quot;</p>
<p>I was led to believe I could move away and build a life... what about removing
my kids from their school classes, or uprooting my family from our church
community... What possible value could there be in forcing this kind of
disruption on a high-performing individual? It's clearly not about productivity</p>
<div class="admonition danger">
<p>what an assinine idea... It's purely about control and I think it's disgusting</p>
