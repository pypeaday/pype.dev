## Passage

```
Why do you see the speck in the eye of your brother, but you don't perceive the
beam in your own eye?

Or how can you say to your brother, "Allow me to take out the speck from your
eye," and look, the beam is in your eye!

Hypocrite! First take out the beam from your eye, and then you can see clearly
the speck in the eye of your brother.
```

```
Ask and it will be given to you. Seek and you will find. Knock and it will be
hopend to you. For the one who asks will receive, and the one who seeks will
find. And to the one who knocks it will be opened. For what person is among
you, who when their son asks for break, will give him a rock? Or when he asks
for a fish will give him a snake? So then fi you all are bad, but you know how
to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in the
skies give good things to those who ask.
```
## Reflection

James builds on this with `if any of you lacks wisdom then ask for wisdom it
will be given to you`. James is arming us with some specifics from the Sermon
on the Mount. We aren't just to ask for anything that we think is good...
wisdom is the good we are to ask for.

Tim: Prayer is important because wisdom will flow out of a deep interpersonal
relationship with God.

### Where has God given me wisdom?

1. Marriage/relationships as Kassia and I have navigated many things (job changes, moving for family, family falling through, unhealthy parent relationships, church hunts, and our own self-development and discovery)
2. He's given me a lot of professional wisdom - potentially through AuDHD and the exposure he's brought me through. 
3. Through Mark Forstrom, Andrew, Nick Z, etc. I was filled with wisdom on how to be a man in the life of a boy - how to talk with someone immature, let them be and feel heard, but also on how to challenge them to grow (up).
