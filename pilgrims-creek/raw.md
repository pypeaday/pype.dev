# What

Podcast with Cameron for weary theologians. We spend time discussing interesting topics, approaches to theology, etc. all from the perspective of travelers who are tired and need a place to just have good conversation. We're not here to fight theological points or debate, but rather to explore the patterns in the Bible, equip ourselves and others with theological tools, and overall enjoy a good time with believers interacting with fun and challenging ideas about our faith
