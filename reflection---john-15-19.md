  shall be unfaithful, till Jesus shall\n    cease to be the truth, thou art safe.\n\n!!!
  note \"John 15:19\"\n\n    If you were of the world, the world would love its own.
  But because you are\n    not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, for
  this reason the world\n    hates you.\n\n## The World\n\n\"Not of this world\" was
  a clothing brand when I was a kid that made emo-styled\nclothing so edgy teens could
  be reminded to live a moral life. This was at\nleast how I took the phrase \"Not
  of this world\" for most of my life...\n\nThe phrase shouldn't be trivialized. But
  as it was to me (not to blame that\nclothing brand) it turned one of the most freeing
  truths about Yahweh's\nsovereignty into a list of do's and don't's. It actually
  moralizes Jesus in\npretty much the same way anyone does who brings him up when
  it's convenient for\ntheir political argument.\n\nThat irony is actually kind of
  funny to me right now... Jesus explicitly tells\nhis disciples that they are not
  of this world, because God has chosen them (see\n[[helkyo-what-is-it-for-god-to-draw-man-to-him]]
  for some thoughts on it). And\nhere we go, doing exactly what the world would otherwise
  do with his teaching.\n\n## Reflection\n\nI almost feel like my reflections have
  all been the same thing in recent\nweeks... The freedom offered by Jesus to those
  chosen from before the beginning\nof time is beautiful. It's beautiful because that
  freedom, which is actually\nfreedom to follow Jesus, is what leads to human flourishing.
  Not necessarily\nthe fastest technological advancements (but according to the story
  of Genesis 6\nand the Watchers, technology can enable humans to do much more harm
  than good),\nbut the most-human life we can live is one in community with God and
  his\npeople.\n\nThe highest calling of man is to glorify God and honor him - and
  of course that\ncalling is only actually achievable by those he calls. It has nothing
  to do\nwith why he calls them, **no one** in God's family can claim to have earned\ntheir
  place. That's the beauty. And for Christians, that ought to drive us to\ninteract
  with non-believers perhaps differently...\n\nToo many Christians do I know who have
  Christian-expectations for\nnon-Christians... I have been to plenty of small groups
  where a topic becomes\nthe ridiculous level of debauchery celebrated in the public
  square. My fellow\nChristian brothers may rightly point out evil and wickedness
  but often it's\npaired with disappointment... To that I always say \"why?\".\n\n!!!
  danger \"\"\n\n    What other expectation is there of a godless community than godless
  behavior?\n\nIt's precisely because the Father chose the believers and gives them
  to Jesus\nthat they/we should live how humans were designed to live - in accordance
  with\nYahweh's kingship of the world. In submitting to Yahweh, by his own election,\nthe
  world (which celebrates debauchery) will inevitably hate the believer.\nThe believer
  should also come to hate the debauchery. But nowhere in this\nlogical line of thinking
  here do I see reason to be disappointed or surprised\nin the world... once again,
  if the Father has not chosen you **out of it** then\n**what else would any believer
  expect?**\n\nSo what about me? Reflections aren't meant for focusing on \"them\"...
  So, Jesus\nsays that I'm \"not of this world\" and that the world will hate me.
  I've\ncertainly faced anger and hatred over my faith, but what else would I expect?!\nHowever,
  I don't think that Jesus means here that we should strive to be hated by\nthe world,
  or that being hated is confirmation that we're doing things right.\nNo, it's not
  about behavior - it's about reality. The reality that the\nbeliever has, that I
  have, been chosen.\n\nTo that reality I echo Spurgeon's words\n\n> If Jesus undertook
  to bring me to glory, and if the Father promised that he would give me to the Son
  to be a part of the infinite reward of the travail of his soul; then, my soul, till
  God himself shall be unfaithful, till Jesus shall cease to be the truth, thou art
  safe.\n\nMy soul, thou art safe."

    was a clothing brand when I was a kid that made emo-styled\nclothing so edgy teens
    could be reminded to live a moral life. This was at\nleast how I took the phrase
    &quot;Not of this world&quot; for most of my life...</p>\n<p>The phrase shouldn't
    be trivialized. But as it was to me (not to blame that\nclothing brand) it turned
    one of the most freeing truths about Yahweh's\nsovereignty into a list of do's
    and don't's. It actually moralizes Jesus in\npretty much the same way anyone does
    who brings him up when it's convenient for\ntheir political argument.</p>\n<p>That
    irony is actually kind of funny to me right now... Jesus explicitly tells\nhis
    disciples that they are not of this world, because God has chosen them (see\n<a
    class=\"wikilink\" href=\"/helkyo-what-is-it-for-god-to-draw-man-to-him\">helkyo-what-is-it-for-god-to-draw-man-to-him</a>

    otherwise do with his teaching.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reflection\">Reflection <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    reflections have all been the same thing in recent\nweeks... The freedom offered
    by Jesus to those chosen from before the beginning\nof time is beautiful. It's
    beautiful because that freedom, which is actually\nfreedom to follow Jesus, is
    what leads to human flourishing. Not necessarily\nthe fastest technological advancements
    (but according to the story of Genesis 6\nand the Watchers, technology can enable
    humans to do much more harm than good),\nbut the most-human life we can live is
    one in community with God and his\npeople.</p>\n<p>The highest calling of man
    is to glorify God and honor him - and of course that\ncalling is only actually
    achievable by those he calls. It has nothing to do\nwith why he calls them, <strong>no
    one</strong> in God's family can claim to have earned\ntheir place. That's the
    beauty. And for Christians, that ought to drive us to\ninteract with non-believers
    perhaps differently...</p>\n<p>Too many Christians do I know who have Christian-expectations
    for\nnon-Christians... I have been to plenty of small groups where a topic becomes\nthe
    ridiculous level of debauchery celebrated in the public square. My fellow\nChristian
    brothers may rightly point out evil and wickedness but often it's\npaired with
    disappointment... To that I always say &quot;why?&quot;.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition
    danger\">\n<p>What other expectation is there of a godless community than godless
    behavior?</p>\n</div>\n<p>It's precisely because the Father chose the believers
    and gives them to Jesus\nthat they/we should live how humans were designed to
    live - in accordance with\nYahweh's kingship of the world. In submitting to Yahweh,
    by his own election,\nthe world (which celebrates debauchery) will inevitably
    hate the believer.\nThe believer should also come to hate the debauchery. But
    nowhere in this\nlogical line of thinking here do I see reason to be disappointed
    or surprised\nin the world... once again, if the Father has not chosen you <strong>out
    of it</strong> then\n<strong>what else would any believer expect?</strong></p>\n<p>So
    what about me? Reflections aren't meant for focusing on &quot;them&quot;... So,
    Jesus\nsays that I'm &quot;not of this world&quot; and that the world will hate
    me. I've\ncertainly faced anger and hatred over my faith, but what else would
    I expect?!\nHowever, I don't think that Jesus means here that we should strive
    to be hated by\nthe world, or that being hated is confirmation that we're doing
    things right.\nNo, it's not about behavior - it's about reality. The reality that
    the\nbeliever has, that I have, been chosen.</p>\n<p>To that reality I echo Spurgeon's
    words</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If Jesus undertook to bring me to glory, and if the
    Father promised that he would give me to the Son to be a part of the infinite
    reward of the travail of his soul; then, my soul, till God himself shall be unfaithful,
    till Jesus shall cease to be the truth, thou art safe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My
    soul, thou art safe.</p>\n\n    </section>\n</article>        </div>\n    </main>\n\n</div>\n

    was a clothing brand when I was a kid that made emo-styled\nclothing so edgy teens
    could be reminded to live a moral life. This was at\nleast how I took the phrase
    &quot;Not of this world&quot; for most of my life...</p>\n<p>The phrase shouldn't
    be trivialized. But as it was to me (not to blame that\nclothing brand) it turned
    one of the most freeing truths about Yahweh's\nsovereignty into a list of do's
    and don't's. It actually moralizes Jesus in\npretty much the same way anyone does
    who brings him up when it's convenient for\ntheir political argument.</p>\n<p>That
    irony is actually kind of funny to me right now... Jesus explicitly tells\nhis
    disciples that they are not of this world, because God has chosen them (see\n<a

    reflections have all been the same thing in recent\nweeks... The freedom offered
    by Jesus to those chosen from before the beginning\nof time is beautiful. It's
    beautiful because that freedom, which is actually\nfreedom to follow Jesus, is
    what leads to human flourishing. Not necessarily\nthe fastest technological advancements
    (but according to the story of Genesis 6\nand the Watchers, technology can enable
    humans to do much more harm than good),\nbut the most-human life we can live is
    one in community with God and his\npeople.</p>\n<p>The highest calling of man
    is to glorify God and honor him - and of course that\ncalling is only actually
    achievable by those he calls. It has nothing to do\nwith why he calls them, <strong>no
    one</strong> in God's family can claim to have earned\ntheir place. That's the
    beauty. And for Christians, that ought to drive us to\ninteract with non-believers
    perhaps differently...</p>\n<p>Too many Christians do I know who have Christian-expectations
    for\nnon-Christians... I have been to plenty of small groups where a topic becomes\nthe
    ridiculous level of debauchery celebrated in the public square. My fellow\nChristian
    brothers may rightly point out evil and wickedness but often it's\npaired with
    disappointment... To that I always say &quot;why?&quot;.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition
    danger\">\n<p>What other expectation is there of a godless community than godless
    behavior?</p>\n</div>\n<p>It's precisely because the Father chose the believers
    and gives them to Jesus\nthat they/we should live how humans were designed to
    live - in accordance with\nYahweh's kingship of the world. In submitting to Yahweh,
    by his own election,\nthe world (which celebrates debauchery) will inevitably
    hate the believer.\nThe believer should also come to hate the debauchery. But
    nowhere in this\nlogical line of thinking here do I see reason to be disappointed
    or surprised\nin the world... once again, if the Father has not chosen you <strong>out
    of it</strong> then\n<strong>what else would any believer expect?</strong></p>\n<p>So
    what about me? Reflections aren't meant for focusing on &quot;them&quot;... So,
    Jesus\nsays that I'm &quot;not of this world&quot; and that the world will hate
    me. I've\ncertainly faced anger and hatred over my faith, but what else would
    I expect?!\nHowever, I don't think that Jesus means here that we should strive
    to be hated by\nthe world, or that being hated is confirmation that we're doing
    things right.\nNo, it's not about behavior - it's about reality. The reality that
    the\nbeliever has, that I have, been chosen.</p>\n<p>To that reality I echo Spurgeon's
    words</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If Jesus undertook to bring me to glory, and if the
    Father promised that he would give me to the Son to be a part of the infinite
    reward of the travail of his soul; then, my soul, till God himself shall be unfaithful,
    till Jesus shall cease to be the truth, thou art safe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My
    soul, thou art safe.</p>\n\n    </section>\n</article>"

    was a clothing brand when I was a kid that made emo-styled\nclothing so edgy teens
    could be reminded to live a moral life. This was at\nleast how I took the phrase
    &quot;Not of this world&quot; for most of my life...</p>\n<p>The phrase shouldn't
    be trivialized. But as it was to me (not to blame that\nclothing brand) it turned
    one of the most freeing truths about Yahweh's\nsovereignty into a list of do's

    who brings him up when it's convenient for\ntheir political argument.</p>\n<p>That
    irony is actually kind of funny to me right now... Jesus explicitly tells\nhis
    disciples that they are not of this world, because God has chosen them (see\n<a

!!! note "Spurgeon"

    If Jesus undertook to bring me to glory, and if the Father promised that he
    would give me to the Son to be a part of the infinite reward of the travail of
    his soul; then, my soul, till God himself shall be unfaithful, till Jesus shall
    cease to be the truth, thou art safe.

!!! note "John 15:19"

    If you were of the world, the world would love its own. But because you are
    not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, for this reason the world
    hates you.

## The World

"Not of this world" was a clothing brand when I was a kid that made emo-styled
clothing so edgy teens could be reminded to live a moral life. This was at
least how I took the phrase "Not of this world" for most of my life...

The phrase shouldn't be trivialized. But as it was to me (not to blame that
clothing brand) it turned one of the most freeing truths about Yahweh's
sovereignty into a list of do's and don't's. It actually moralizes Jesus in
pretty much the same way anyone does who brings him up when it's convenient for
their political argument.

That irony is actually kind of funny to me right now... Jesus explicitly tells
his disciples that they are not of this world, because God has chosen them (see
[[helkyo-what-is-it-for-god-to-draw-man-to-him]] for some thoughts on it). And
here we go, doing exactly what the world would otherwise do with his teaching.

## Reflection

I almost feel like my reflections have all been the same thing in recent
weeks... The freedom offered by Jesus to those chosen from before the beginning
of time is beautiful. It's beautiful because that freedom, which is actually
freedom to follow Jesus, is what leads to human flourishing. Not necessarily
the fastest technological advancements (but according to the story of Genesis 6
and the Watchers, technology can enable humans to do much more harm than good),
but the most-human life we can live is one in community with God and his
people.

The highest calling of man is to glorify God and honor him - and of course that
calling is only actually achievable by those he calls. It has nothing to do
with why he calls them, **no one** in God's family can claim to have earned
their place. That's the beauty. And for Christians, that ought to drive us to
interact with non-believers perhaps differently...

Too many Christians do I know who have Christian-expectations for
non-Christians... I have been to plenty of small groups where a topic becomes
the ridiculous level of debauchery celebrated in the public square. My fellow
Christian brothers may rightly point out evil and wickedness but often it's
paired with disappointment... To that I always say "why?".

!!! danger ""

    What other expectation is there of a godless community than godless behavior?

It's precisely because the Father chose the believers and gives them to Jesus
that they/we should live how humans were designed to live - in accordance with
Yahweh's kingship of the world. In submitting to Yahweh, by his own election,
the world (which celebrates debauchery) will inevitably hate the believer.
The believer should also come to hate the debauchery. But nowhere in this
logical line of thinking here do I see reason to be disappointed or surprised
in the world... once again, if the Father has not chosen you **out of it** then
**what else would any believer expect?**

So what about me? Reflections aren't meant for focusing on "them"... So, Jesus
says that I'm "not of this world" and that the world will hate me. I've
certainly faced anger and hatred over my faith, but what else would I expect?!
However, I don't think that Jesus means here that we should strive to be hated by
the world, or that being hated is confirmation that we're doing things right.
No, it's not about behavior - it's about reality. The reality that the
believer has, that I have, been chosen.

To that reality I echo Spurgeon's words

> If Jesus undertook to bring me to glory, and if the Father promised that he would give me to the Son to be a part of the infinite reward of the travail of his soul; then, my soul, till God himself shall be unfaithful, till Jesus shall cease to be the truth, thou art safe.

My soul, thou art safe.
