Oddly enough I am just now really getting into the second brain idea... a zettlekasten has been taking shape in my life through the use of markata and some markdown plugins for neovim... Interesting to see Derek here giving up on the idea... I wonder what my second brain will look like in the next few years... I certainly hope it remain valuable to me and doesn't become a burden...

One thing in this post I find interesting is that Derek said keeping his second brain might stop him from reading due to the pressure to take notes - but ironically, NOT having a second brain has stopped me from reading because I get paralyzed about where to keep notes, how to use them later, etc... I like the system taking shape in my life, and again I hope it only increases in value as time goes on.
