<p class="admonition-title">Psalm 105:43</p>
<p>And so he brought out his people with joy,  his chosen ones with rejoicing.</p>
</div>
<p>Joy is a toughy right now if I'm honest... Today marks the 3rd week of Advent,
today we light the Joy candle. But honestly, joy is one that's not just tough
now, it's a hard thing for me in general... &quot;Hope&quot; I feel like I get, I long for
the consummation of Heaven. &quot;Peace&quot; is another one that I can't say I experience
all the time, but I know what it is, and I have felt, and do feel, &quot;peace&quot; to
divine degrees at times. Joy though... I'm an excitable person, I'm passionate
about the things I'm passionate about, but &quot;joy&quot; isn't an emotion or
state-of-being that I feel very familiar with.</p>
<p>It's probably not correct to use the word &quot;emotion&quot; for the Advent-pillar of
<code>Joy</code>, but it doesn't feel wholly inappropriate either... I think of 'joy' as
an outward response to a thing, and if I were to be pressed to think about what
&quot;inward-joy&quot; might be, I think I'd default to how I understand &quot;peace&quot;.</p>
<p>Joy, though, can't only be outward, there must be something internal... &quot;Peace&quot;
reminds me of feelings like calm and serenity to me, but &quot;joy&quot; reminds me of
feelings of happiness and gratitude... Maybe that's where joy becomes almost a
virtue - happiness accompanied with gratitude.</p>
<p>I suppose with that springboard, I feel great joy when I'm with close friends,
experiencing community with people who really know me. I don't know what it
says about me that the most recent time of excessive &quot;joy&quot; I can remember was
from a weekend-getaway trip to the Dells with our best friends back in
January... We don't get to see Michael and Kathryn (+ the kiddos!) very often.
By God's grace on their lives, we are 1 of many close family-friends to
them. By God's same grace on our lives, they are 1 of a <strong>very few</strong> close
family-friends to us, and so when we do get to see them and plan a few days
together every couple of years, it warms my heart so much that if we booked the
next trip this morning I'd forget about being sick and how cold it is outside
(wind chill -29F).</p>
<p>Things for me right this very second are not incredibly joyful, but all things
considered it's impossible to not find peace in the provision of Yahweh in my
life. I'm thankful for when joy enters my being and I get to experience it, I
pray Jesus broadens my heart and mind this week during the reflections on Joy
for the sake my own righteousness.</p>
