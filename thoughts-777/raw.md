Here's my thought on <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-remarkable-incompetence-at-the-heart-of-tech/">ðŸ’­ The Remarkable Incompetence At The Heart Of Tech</a>

What a great post... the majority of my tech experience has been at a large non-tech company and this just couldn't be more true... we've got folks who made 150k+ in just cash salary who would take 3 months to learn what a firewall rule even was... I heard at one time there were 6 different salesforce accounts across 3 different cloud providers... The incompetence in management, new-hires, those in charge of hiring, etc. is just mind-boggling. 
I have been fortunate to have generally awesome peers and helpful direct managers but generally I see every ounce of truth in this article... but what does it matter? I kind of think it doesn't... there's nothing I or anyone can do to change this wide-spread problem... companies will throw money at other companies while employing dozens (if not more) of engineers who think Excel is Big Data...

overall great read, much respect
