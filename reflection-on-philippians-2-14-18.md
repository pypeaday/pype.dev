content: "!!! note \"Philippians 2:15-18\"\n\n    14\_Do all things without grumbling
  and disputing, 15\_in order that you may\n    become blameless and innocent, children
  of God without fault in the midst of a\n    crooked and perverted generation, among
  whom you shine as stars in the world,\n    16\_holding fast to the word of life,
  for a source of pride to me in the day of\n    Christ, that I did not run in vain
  or labor in vain. 17\_But even if I am being\n    poured out as a drink offering
  on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I\n    rejoice and rejoice with all
  of you. 18\_And in the same way also you rejoice\n    and rejoice with me. \n\n\"Do
  all things without grumbling and disputing\"... now, taking verses out of\ncontext
  is one of my biggest pet-peeves in Christian circles (and non-Christian\nas well
  I suppose, but when non-believers who read 4 pages of the Bible 20\nyears ago try
  to tell me what anything means I can kindly ask them to keep\ntheir illiteracy to
  themselves)\n\nHowever! With my brothers and sisters, there's no such ask - if we
  all call on\nJesus then we will edifiy and educate one another on appropriate applications\nof
  the inspired word of God.\n\nWith that said... dang do I grumble a lot about work...
  at least lately. I\nbelieve that nearly everyone I work with knows my worldview,
  I don't think\nanyone who spends a few days, maybe even hours (by God's grace) will
  know who I\nserve just by my languge and verbiage. But I'm not a prime example of
  Christian\nliving (yet... hopefully). I had been [[reflecting-on-romans-7-7-13]]
  for\nseveral days and the \"sin in me\" is what I see come out when I let my guard\ndown
  against letting strife and anger enter my heart.\n\nI read this passage and found
  myself immediately focused on \"in the midst of a\ncrooked and perverted generation\"
  because our generation is disgusting... I\nknow immorality and public perverted-ness
  was present in the before-fore times,\nbut I have to imagine that Paul and the other
  NT writers couldn't have imagined\nthe kind of disgusting perverted anti-nature
  nonsense that is everywhere in our\nsociety. We celebrate sex over everything, and
  a twisted understanding of sex\nfor that matter... My daughter's are growing up
  in a world where I feel the\nneed to practice constant vigilence against the evil
  forces in the world that\nwould seek to them and twist their understanding of themselves
  into nothing\nmore than objects of desire and consumption... And ya know what, that's
  a\nworthy thing to meditate on and prepare for.\n\nBut it's not what my heart needs...
  My girls are relatively safe (for the time\nbeing) but everyday I face the sin of
  my own heart, it's crouching at the door,\nand should not that be my higher concern?\n\nI
  even notice now in this reflection that my mind is drawn away from myself,\nand
  it is difficult to follow the Lord in meditation... perhaps it's too noisey\nbut
  perhaps I'm looking for too much...\n\nThis day I choose whom I will serve, and
  by God's grace it's the King Jesus...\nHelp my unbelief and still the grumbling
  in my life."

    2:15-18</p>\n<p>14\_Do all things without grumbling and disputing, 15\_in order
    that you may\nbecome blameless and innocent, children of God without fault in
    the midst of a\ncrooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as stars
    in the world,\n16\_holding fast to the word of life, for a source of pride to
    me in the day of\nChrist, that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. 17\_But
    even if I am being\npoured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service
    of your faith, I\nrejoice and rejoice with all of you. 18\_And in the same way
    also you rejoice\nand rejoice with me.</p>\n</div>\n<p>&quot;Do all things without
    grumbling and disputing&quot;... now, taking verses out of\ncontext is one of
    my biggest pet-peeves in Christian circles (and non-Christian\nas well I suppose,
    but when non-believers who read 4 pages of the Bible 20\nyears ago try to tell
    me what anything means I can kindly ask them to keep\ntheir illiteracy to themselves)</p>\n<p>However!
    With my brothers and sisters, there's no such ask - if we all call on\nJesus then
    we will edifiy and educate one another on appropriate applications\nof the inspired
    word of God.</p>\n<p>With that said... dang do I grumble a lot about work... at
    least lately. I\nbelieve that nearly everyone I work with knows my worldview,
    I don't think\nanyone who spends a few days, maybe even hours (by God's grace)
    will know who I\nserve just by my languge and verbiage. But I'm not a prime example
    of Christian\nliving (yet... hopefully). I had been <a class=\"wikilink\" href=\"/reflecting-on-romans-7-7-13\">reflecting-on-romans-7-7-13</a>
    for\nseveral days and the &quot;sin in me&quot; is what I see come out when I
    let my guard\ndown against letting strife and anger enter my heart.</p>\n<p>I
    read this passage and found myself immediately focused on &quot;in the midst of
    a\ncrooked and perverted generation&quot; because our generation is disgusting...
    I\nknow immorality and public perverted-ness was present in the before-fore times,\nbut
    I have to imagine that Paul and the other NT writers couldn't have imagined\nthe
    kind of disgusting perverted anti-nature nonsense that is everywhere in our\nsociety.
    We celebrate sex over everything, and a twisted understanding of sex\nfor that
    matter... My daughter's are growing up in a world where I feel the\nneed to practice
    constant vigilence against the evil forces in the world that\nwould seek to them
    and twist their understanding of themselves into nothing\nmore than objects of
    desire and consumption... And ya know what, that's a\nworthy thing to meditate
    on and prepare for.</p>\n<p>But it's not what my heart needs... My girls are relatively
    safe (for the time\nbeing) but everyday I face the sin of my own heart, it's crouching
    at the door,\nand should not that be my higher concern?</p>\n<p>I even notice
    now in this reflection that my mind is drawn away from myself,\nand it is difficult
    to follow the Lord in meditation... perhaps it's too noisey\nbut perhaps I'm looking
    for too much...</p>\n<p>This day I choose whom I will serve, and by God's grace
    it's the King Jesus...\nHelp my unbelief and still the grumbling in my life.</p>\n\n

    2:15-18</p>\n<p>14\_Do all things without grumbling and disputing, 15\_in order
    that you may\nbecome blameless and innocent, children of God without fault in
    the midst of a\ncrooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as stars
    in the world,\n16\_holding fast to the word of life, for a source of pride to
    me in the day of\nChrist, that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. 17\_But
    even if I am being\npoured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service
    of your faith, I\nrejoice and rejoice with all of you. 18\_And in the same way
    also you rejoice\nand rejoice with me.</p>\n</div>\n<p>&quot;Do all things without
    grumbling and disputing&quot;... now, taking verses out of\ncontext is one of
    my biggest pet-peeves in Christian circles (and non-Christian\nas well I suppose,
    but when non-believers who read 4 pages of the Bible 20\nyears ago try to tell
    me what anything means I can kindly ask them to keep\ntheir illiteracy to themselves)</p>\n<p>However!
    With my brothers and sisters, there's no such ask - if we all call on\nJesus then
    we will edifiy and educate one another on appropriate applications\nof the inspired
    word of God.</p>\n<p>With that said... dang do I grumble a lot about work... at
    least lately. I\nbelieve that nearly everyone I work with knows my worldview,
    I don't think\nanyone who spends a few days, maybe even hours (by God's grace)
    will know who I\nserve just by my languge and verbiage. But I'm not a prime example
    of Christian\nliving (yet... hopefully). I had been <a class=\"wikilink\" href=\"/reflecting-on-romans-7-7-13\">reflecting-on-romans-7-7-13</a>
    for\nseveral days and the &quot;sin in me&quot; is what I see come out when I
    let my guard\ndown against letting strife and anger enter my heart.</p>\n<p>I
    read this passage and found myself immediately focused on &quot;in the midst of
    a\ncrooked and perverted generation&quot; because our generation is disgusting...
    I\nknow immorality and public perverted-ness was present in the before-fore times,\nbut
    I have to imagine that Paul and the other NT writers couldn't have imagined\nthe
    kind of disgusting perverted anti-nature nonsense that is everywhere in our\nsociety.
    We celebrate sex over everything, and a twisted understanding of sex\nfor that
    matter... My daughter's are growing up in a world where I feel the\nneed to practice
    constant vigilence against the evil forces in the world that\nwould seek to them
    and twist their understanding of themselves into nothing\nmore than objects of
    desire and consumption... And ya know what, that's a\nworthy thing to meditate
    on and prepare for.</p>\n<p>But it's not what my heart needs... My girls are relatively
    safe (for the time\nbeing) but everyday I face the sin of my own heart, it's crouching
    at the door,\nand should not that be my higher concern?</p>\n<p>I even notice
    now in this reflection that my mind is drawn away from myself,\nand it is difficult
    to follow the Lord in meditation... perhaps it's too noisey\nbut perhaps I'm looking
    for too much...</p>\n<p>This day I choose whom I will serve, and by God's grace
    it's the King Jesus...\nHelp my unbelief and still the grumbling in my life.</p>\n\n

!!! note "Philippians 2:15-18"

    14 Do all things without grumbling and disputing, 15 in order that you may
    become blameless and innocent, children of God without fault in the midst of a
    crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as stars in the world,
    16 holding fast to the word of life, for a source of pride to me in the day of
    Christ, that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. 17 But even if I am being
    poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I
    rejoice and rejoice with all of you. 18 And in the same way also you rejoice
    and rejoice with me. 

"Do all things without grumbling and disputing"... now, taking verses out of
context is one of my biggest pet-peeves in Christian circles (and non-Christian
as well I suppose, but when non-believers who read 4 pages of the Bible 20
years ago try to tell me what anything means I can kindly ask them to keep
their illiteracy to themselves)

However! With my brothers and sisters, there's no such ask - if we all call on
Jesus then we will edifiy and educate one another on appropriate applications
of the inspired word of God.

With that said... dang do I grumble a lot about work... at least lately. I
believe that nearly everyone I work with knows my worldview, I don't think
anyone who spends a few days, maybe even hours (by God's grace) will know who I
serve just by my languge and verbiage. But I'm not a prime example of Christian
living (yet... hopefully). I had been [[reflecting-on-romans-7-7-13]] for
several days and the "sin in me" is what I see come out when I let my guard
down against letting strife and anger enter my heart.

I read this passage and found myself immediately focused on "in the midst of a
crooked and perverted generation" because our generation is disgusting... I
know immorality and public perverted-ness was present in the before-fore times,
but I have to imagine that Paul and the other NT writers couldn't have imagined
the kind of disgusting perverted anti-nature nonsense that is everywhere in our
society. We celebrate sex over everything, and a twisted understanding of sex
for that matter... My daughter's are growing up in a world where I feel the
need to practice constant vigilence against the evil forces in the world that
would seek to them and twist their understanding of themselves into nothing
more than objects of desire and consumption... And ya know what, that's a
worthy thing to meditate on and prepare for.

But it's not what my heart needs... My girls are relatively safe (for the time
being) but everyday I face the sin of my own heart, it's crouching at the door,
and should not that be my higher concern?

I even notice now in this reflection that my mind is drawn away from myself,
and it is difficult to follow the Lord in meditation... perhaps it's too noisey
but perhaps I'm looking for too much...

This day I choose whom I will serve, and by God's grace it's the King Jesus...
Help my unbelief and still the grumbling in my life.
