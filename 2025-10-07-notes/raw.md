## Quick Thought

- Something I"ve noticed about myself recently is how naturally try to exploit systems. I don't mean in a nefarious way or anything, but as I think about [[thinking-in-diagrams]] I'm sort of always drawing out a system in my head thinking about ways to shim information or workflows into parts of that system. I feel like there's gotta be a name for this pattern of thinking but it was just something that came to my mind last night. For example I'm building a notifications service right now and I have several ideas I think I could build on top of it - so while I'm trying to plan for those future ideas I basically try to construct the base framework layer in such a way that I can take advantage of different entrypoints to the data model as a way to "exploit" the larger system for a more specific use case. MAybe you'd just refer to this as planning ahead, but it feels in my inner-being a little more scrappy than that. As I've built "distrbuted" systems over the years (mostly like CI/CD, not large systems of scale to be honest) I notice I'm always planning a spot to "hook into" whatever thing I'm building. I don't know where this thought might go, perhaps nowhere, but maybe there's something to systems-design and thinking in this way of being sensitive to exploit paths (though again, not necessarily nefarious, just as a way to add features to a system).
