Here's my thought on <a href="https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit/pull/4704">ðŸ’­ Add confirmation for hard reset by stefanhaller Â· Pull Request...</a>

I float between lazygit and gitui still for my terminal-based git flow and I want to lean into lazygit more fully. One issue is that the keybinding for lazygit <C-d> brings up a menu there the first option is to nuke the entire working tree... in gitui this just resets the one file that's highlighted in the TUI. So that's obviously 100% my fault, however it's nice to see this PR open for adding confirmation for this potential blunder that has cost me several uncommitted scripts and changes...
