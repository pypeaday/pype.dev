## Today

- Playing in Waupaca volleyball tournament
- Saw news about OpenAI Windsurf deal falling through
- Started setting up
  [affine](https://docs.affine.pro/self-host-affine/install/docker-compose-recommend)
  to try a self-hosted option for mind mapping... draw.io is ok, excalidraw is
  ok, but I feel like for mind mapping there's gotta be a better tool than what
  I'd use for infra diagrams... maybe not, but affine looks interesting to at
  least spin up nonetheless and thankfully it's just `docker compose up`

## Affine

You have to go to `<affine-url>/admin` for the admin setup, and from there
there is no link to the root page where you can see the workspaces... good to
note

### WHY

One of the things that comes up in my mind every now and then is a way to map
out BJJ flows... like given position A start a flow chart based on opponent
decisions. Or flow charts of execution steps of passes or things like that...

Needing the mind map feels similar to linking my posts together, but it's like
more detailed - I need a lot of space for many different ideas, whereas with
text notes pretty much all the space is given to one note (or one link in all
the map).

I also think in diagrams a lot - see [[thinking-in-diagrams#Intro]] and so
having a nice place to keep all my diagrams has felt like a dream. I go back
and forth with draw.io and excalidraw for various things both personal and
work, and I just don't know how to pick one over the other. So maybe moving to
a different style of platform with Affine (which is Notion-esq) will help me
organize the mind maps in a meaningful way

## Volleyball

I got to play in America's largest volleyball tournament which takes place in Waupaca

## For tomorrow

- More with affine and mind-mapping (I bookmarked a TT BJJ video I wanted to make a map of from JFlo)
- Write up more on restic - how to check backups etc. (and do it while you write it up... duh)
- don't lose sight of [[thoughts-to-nostr]]
- or [[daily-notes-neovim-plugin]]
