Here's my thought on <a href="https://waylonwalker.com/uv-script-management/##sed+-i+'1i+#!/usr/bin/env+-S+uv+run+--script'+up">ðŸ’­ uv script management</a>

Dang Waylon! Love these few lines... `uv` is great, been using it for environment and project requirements management but I didn't realize it was this easy to setup a pep 723 compliant script!

Love this `sed -i '1i #!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script'` little gem too - I typically do `uv run script.py` so I'll see about making this a simple zsh alias for faster iteration on python scripts... I often have AI write quick bash scripts to accomplish things, but it's quite a bit harder for me to read than python, and with the power `uv` is bringing to the python ecosystem, maybe it's fine to just be a little higher in the programming stack for script-kitty stuff
