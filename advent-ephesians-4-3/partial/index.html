<p class="admonition-title">Ephesians 4:1-6</p>
<p>4Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord, exhort you to live in a manner
worthy of the calling with which you were called: 2 with all humility and
gentleness, with patience, putting up with one another in love, 3 being eager
to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace; 4 one body and one Spirit
(just as also you were called with one hope of your calling), 5 one Lord, one
faith, one baptism, 6 one God and Father of all, who is over all, and through
all, and in all.</p>

<p>Once again I say &quot;Praise God&quot; this morning for more words of Scripture that
succinctly highlight the beauty of the Gospel.</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;I, the prisoner in the Lord...&quot; No one knows better than Paul that if Jesus
says &quot;Come to me&quot; you have no choice but to obey.</li>
<li>&quot;with humility, gentleness, and patience put up with one another in love, be
eager to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace&quot;. Christian
community was literally the talk of the town in the early church - it was so
odd that historians have written about &quot;The Way&quot; (the early early name of the
Christian movement). Acts says believers &quot;had all things in common&quot;. Jesus
brings unity that transcends any differences between us.</li>
<li>&quot;one...one...one...&quot; Paul is saying so clearly that we are one family in
Christa. Later in the same letter he says &quot;be eager to do good to all, and
especially to those in the household of faith&quot;. Christians should be meeting
the needs of those around them, but even more so meeting the needs of our
brothers and sisters in Christ.</li>
</ol>
<p>I really strive for unity... My whole life people have accused me of loving an
argument (which is true) but I am not pugnacious. I do not enjoy fighting - I
do enjoy rhetoric and debate, but by God's grace I hate division. There are
several examples I can point to in my life where unity and &quot;team spirit&quot; was
important to me.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Simple Example</p>
<p>I worked for Summit Ministries for several summers, eventually serving on
some leadership positions. While in those positions I wanted to do &quot;extra&quot;
things to unify our counselors, and one was that every year I'd design a
sweatshirt that we'd all (or most of us) would buy. I just love the idea of
being united for a common and GOOD goal.o</p>
</div>
<p>Christians should be the most unified and loving people on the planet...
unfortunately that isn't the case, and I know a lot of people in and out of the
Church who have experienced great disunity and division. That really is
unfortunate, but I think the only thing I can do is march forward to the beat
of the drum Jesus has for me. And one of those beats is to strive for unity
&quot;putting up with one another in love, being eager to keep the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace&quot;</p>
