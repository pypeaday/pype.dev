content: "At some point in the recent history of my country, political tensions began\nincreasing
  exponentially between our 2 parties, and I had hardly cared until\nright around
  2021/2022. There were policies and patterns emerging in the public\nsphere that
  were troubling to me, and I've sense developed some hard opinions.\n\nA man was
  just murdered for holding opinions openly that are not much different\nthan mine
  - at least as far as the innate divisive nature of the opinions... I\nwant my country
  to be safe, I proudly fly the American flag, Jesus saves me\nevery day and although
  America isn't a Christian nation I feel blessed that God\nput me in this country,
  I value open-debate, and I've just so happen to come to\nhold fairly right-leaning
  social positions...\n\n!!! danger \"and they killed this guy for it\"\n\n    Charlie
  Kirk was murdered for daring to challenge college kids around the country to think
  critically about what narrative they are force-fed through media and school\n\nThe
  political landscape of America isn't Left vs Right... I mean it is, and in\nthat
  dichotomy unfortunately I am on the Right, but this isn't Democratic\nvalues vs
  Republican values, and I'm not a Republican and most Leftists aren't\nactually Democrats...
  these \"sides\" have both been co-opted by wicked\npeople... In what I've learned,
  I would've said Dems had it right up until the\nmid 2000s, and idk what happened
  but since the 10s-onward the media and\nhonestly a majority of democratic elected-officials
  are the ones CRANKING UP\nTHE VIOLENT RHETORIC. Conservatives are likened to Hitler
  in the media, Charlie\nhimself was called a faccist (what a retarded thing to say...
  accuse the guy\nwho built his career on good-faith debate of being a police-state
  supporter)\nand people with national platforms are daily accusing those on the Right
  of\nbeing hateful simply for wanting to have debate, for not bowing down to\nidentity
  politics and non-arguments.\n\nCharlie is a martyr for freedom, and a victim of
  the violent rhetoric the media\nhas been pushing against the Right ever since Donald
  Trump became the boogy-man.\n\nI value my privacy and I believe in what I believe
  in... I'm not ashamed to\npublically be known for any conviction I hold, but if
  they killed Charlie for\nanything he belived, **they'd kill me too**.\n\nAnd who
  is \"they\"? Charlie was shot 16 hours ago, I have seen no evidence that\nthe shooter
  was a democrat or even on the Left... but what I have seen on\nsocial media is proud
  Leftists celebrating the killing of a young dad, husband,\nChristian, and activist
  for publically encouraging people to debate and to bow\nto the better argument,
  not the stronger more violent opponent.... I don't know\nanything about the man
  who pulled the trigger, but I do know that a disturbing\nnumber of people are comfortable
  putting their face behind a campaign of\nassassination and fear. They're comfortable
  with it because it's socially\naacceptable to call for violence against **some groups**
  of people, primarily\nthe one group that is constantly villianized in absolute ignorance
  - White\nChristian Men... If you don't agree with this then I would say you are
  blinded...\nChristianity is openly mocked, and you wouldn't notice if you wouldn't\nnotice...
  whereas other religions are so openly protected it's become comical to me.\nWhen's
  the last time you felt comfortable making a joke about Islam or Judaism\ncompared
  to Christianity? Even if you wouldn't joke about any of them, you know\nyou'd be
  safe to criticize one publically, and the other 2 you'd face\nconsequences for.
  And these are the things these lunatics celebrate... they\nlove that another White
  Christian Man was removed from God's green earth...\n\n!!! warning \"These poor
  people\"\n\n    I'm not complaining necessarily about Christianity's lack of priviliege
  in the public sphere and my heart breaks for people who hate - period.... to hate
  someone for a difference of worldview or opinion to the point of openly celebrating
  their death is one of the saddest and most sickening realities I can think of.\n\nWhat
  can I do after this? Charlie was just a regular guy. It's one thing to\nhave the
  attempted-assassination of Trump sweapt under the rug, or to brush it\noff as a
  targeted attack against a powerful man. But Charlie wasn't a\npolitician... he was
  just a guy with a job, who went around having\nconversations. The violence against
  the Right is stochastic in nature, but\nincreasingly present as public figures continue
  to use hitler and nazi-fueled\nlanguage against people they disagree with...\n\nPaired
  so closely in time with the news of [The slaying of Iryna\nZarutska](https://www.foxnews.com/us/victim-random-train-stabbing-embraced-american-dream-could-have-taken-world-storm-neighbors-say)\nwho
  was attacked randomly by a man who, all unconfirmed allegations aside, had\nbeen
  arrested 14 times for violent crimes. And yet, in my country of freedom, a\nviolent
  criminal was free to murder a refugee fleeing a war-torn region... (if\nyou watched
  any videos you'll see 4 or 5 people witness the attack, and then do\nnothing as
  Iryna sorrowfully dies, alone and unaided in a foreign country...\nthe victim of
  a monster)\n\nCharlie commented on this event, I have the same feelings about the
  climax I\nthought it led to after years of under-reported race-fueld violence against\nwhite
  people, and he was called a racist just for noticing patterns...\n\nIf they shot
  him for saying something about any of his convictions, for\nbelieving he should
  be allowed to raise his family in safety, to attend church,\nand to openly debate
  for the sake of the better idea - they'd shoot me\nto... and celebrate.\n\nI take
  as much comfort as possible, however minimal, knowing that Charlie loved\nJesus,
  and that his family has the hope of resurrection in the name of Jesus to see\nhim
  again... But 2 kids lost their dad, and a young woman lost her husband,\nlunatics
  celebrate, today is just another day, and if someone would come for a\nnormal guy
  like Charlie, they'd come for you too."

    prose dark:prose-invert\">\n            <p>At some point in the recent history
    of my country, political tensions began\nincreasing exponentially between our
    2 parties, and I had hardly cared until\nright around 2021/2022. There were policies
    and patterns emerging in the public\nsphere that were troubling to me, and I've
    sense developed some hard opinions.</p>\n<p>A man was just murdered for holding
    opinions openly that are not much different\nthan mine - at least as far as the
    innate divisive nature of the opinions... I\nwant my country to be safe, I proudly
    fly the American flag, Jesus saves me\nevery day and although America isn't a
    Christian nation I feel blessed that God\nput me in this country, I value open-debate,
    and I've just so happen to come to\nhold fairly right-leaning social positions...</p>\n<div
    class=\"admonition danger\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">and they killed this
    guy for it</p>\n<p>Charlie Kirk was murdered for daring to challenge college kids
    around the country to think critically about what narrative they are force-fed
    through media and school</p>\n</div>\n<p>The political landscape of America isn't
    Left vs Right... I mean it is, and in\nthat dichotomy unfortunately I am on the
    Right, but this isn't Democratic\nvalues vs Republican values, and I'm not a Republican
    and most Leftists aren't\nactually Democrats... these &quot;sides&quot; have both
    been co-opted by wicked\npeople... In what I've learned, I would've said Dems
    had it right up until the\nmid 2000s, and idk what happened but since the 10s-onward
    the media and\nhonestly a majority of democratic elected-officials are the ones
    CRANKING UP\nTHE VIOLENT RHETORIC. Conservatives are likened to Hitler in the
    media, Charlie\nhimself was called a faccist (what a retarded thing to say...
    accuse the guy\nwho built his career on good-faith debate of being a police-state
    supporter)\nand people with national platforms are daily accusing those on the
    Right of\nbeing hateful simply for wanting to have debate, for not bowing down
    to\nidentity politics and non-arguments.</p>\n<p>Charlie is a martyr for freedom,
    and a victim of the violent rhetoric the media\nhas been pushing against the Right
    ever since Donald Trump became the boogy-man.</p>\n<p>I value my privacy and I
    believe in what I believe in... I'm not ashamed to\npublically be known for any
    conviction I hold, but if they killed Charlie for\nanything he belived, <strong>they'd
    kill me too</strong>.</p>\n<p>And who is &quot;they&quot;? Charlie was shot 16
    hours ago, I have seen no evidence that\nthe shooter was a democrat or even on
    the Left... but what I have seen on\nsocial media is proud Leftists celebrating
    the killing of a young dad, husband,\nChristian, and activist for publically encouraging
    people to debate and to bow\nto the better argument, not the stronger more violent
    opponent.... I don't know\nanything about the man who pulled the trigger, but
    I do know that a disturbing\nnumber of people are comfortable putting their face
    behind a campaign of\nassassination and fear. They're comfortable with it because
    it's socially\naacceptable to call for violence against <strong>some groups</strong>
    of people, primarily\nthe one group that is constantly villianized in absolute
    ignorance - White\nChristian Men... If you don't agree with this then I would
    say you are blinded...\nChristianity is openly mocked, and you wouldn't notice
    if you wouldn't\nnotice... whereas other religions are so openly protected it's
    become comical to me.\nWhen's the last time you felt comfortable making a joke
    about Islam or Judaism\ncompared to Christianity? Even if you wouldn't joke about
    any of them, you know\nyou'd be safe to criticize one publically, and the other
    2 you'd face\nconsequences for. And these are the things these lunatics celebrate...
    they\nlove that another White Christian Man was removed from God's green earth...</p>\n<div
    class=\"admonition warning\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">These poor people</p>\n<p>I'm
    not complaining necessarily about Christianity's lack of priviliege in the public
    sphere and my heart breaks for people who hate - period.... to hate someone for
    a difference of worldview or opinion to the point of openly celebrating their
    death is one of the saddest and most sickening realities I can think of.</p>\n</div>\n<p>What
    can I do after this? Charlie was just a regular guy. It's one thing to\nhave the
    attempted-assassination of Trump sweapt under the rug, or to brush it\noff as
    a targeted attack against a powerful man. But Charlie wasn't a\npolitician...
    he was just a guy with a job, who went around having\nconversations. The violence
    against the Right is stochastic in nature, but\nincreasingly present as public
    figures continue to use hitler and nazi-fueled\nlanguage against people they disagree
    with...</p>\n<p>Paired so closely in time with the news of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/victim-random-train-stabbing-embraced-american-dream-could-have-taken-world-storm-neighbors-say\">The
    slaying of Iryna\nZarutska</a>\nwho was attacked randomly by a man who, all unconfirmed
    allegations aside, had\nbeen arrested 14 times for violent crimes. And yet, in
    my country of freedom, a\nviolent criminal was free to murder a refugee fleeing
    a war-torn region... (if\nyou watched any videos you'll see 4 or 5 people witness
    the attack, and then do\nnothing as Iryna sorrowfully dies, alone and unaided
    in a foreign country...\nthe victim of a monster)</p>\n<p>Charlie commented on
    this event, I have the same feelings about the climax I\nthought it led to after
    years of under-reported race-fueld violence against\nwhite people, and he was
    called a racist just for noticing patterns...</p>\n<p>If they shot him for saying
    something about any of his convictions, for\nbelieving he should be allowed to
    raise his family in safety, to attend church,\nand to openly debate for the sake
    of the better idea - they'd shoot me\nto... and celebrate.</p>\n<p>I take as much
    comfort as possible, however minimal, knowing that Charlie loved\nJesus, and that
    his family has the hope of resurrection in the name of Jesus to see\nhim again...
    But 2 kids lost their dad, and a young woman lost her husband,\nlunatics celebrate,
    today is just another day, and if someone would come for a\nnormal guy like Charlie,
    they'd come for you too.</p>\n\n        </section>\n    </article>\n</section>

title: Reflection - They Can Come For Anyone


---

At some point in the recent history of my country, political tensions began
increasing exponentially between our 2 parties, and I had hardly cared until
right around 2021/2022. There were policies and patterns emerging in the public
sphere that were troubling to me, and I've sense developed some hard opinions.

A man was just murdered for holding opinions openly that are not much different
than mine - at least as far as the innate divisive nature of the opinions... I
want my country to be safe, I proudly fly the American flag, Jesus saves me
every day and although America isn't a Christian nation I feel blessed that God
put me in this country, I value open-debate, and I've just so happen to come to
hold fairly right-leaning social positions...

!!! danger "and they killed this guy for it"

    Charlie Kirk was murdered for daring to challenge college kids around the country to think critically about what narrative they are force-fed through media and school

The political landscape of America isn't Left vs Right... I mean it is, and in
that dichotomy unfortunately I am on the Right, but this isn't Democratic
values vs Republican values, and I'm not a Republican and most Leftists aren't
actually Democrats... these "sides" have both been co-opted by wicked
people... In what I've learned, I would've said Dems had it right up until the
mid 2000s, and idk what happened but since the 10s-onward the media and
honestly a majority of democratic elected-officials are the ones CRANKING UP
THE VIOLENT RHETORIC. Conservatives are likened to Hitler in the media, Charlie
himself was called a faccist (what a retarded thing to say... accuse the guy
who built his career on good-faith debate of being a police-state supporter)
and people with national platforms are daily accusing those on the Right of
being hateful simply for wanting to have debate, for not bowing down to
identity politics and non-arguments.

Charlie is a martyr for freedom, and a victim of the violent rhetoric the media
has been pushing against the Right ever since Donald Trump became the boogy-man.

I value my privacy and I believe in what I believe in... I'm not ashamed to
publically be known for any conviction I hold, but if they killed Charlie for
anything he belived, **they'd kill me too**.

And who is "they"? Charlie was shot 16 hours ago, I have seen no evidence that
the shooter was a democrat or even on the Left... but what I have seen on
social media is proud Leftists celebrating the killing of a young dad, husband,
Christian, and activist for publically encouraging people to debate and to bow
to the better argument, not the stronger more violent opponent.... I don't know
anything about the man who pulled the trigger, but I do know that a disturbing
number of people are comfortable putting their face behind a campaign of
assassination and fear. They're comfortable with it because it's socially
aacceptable to call for violence against **some groups** of people, primarily
the one group that is constantly villianized in absolute ignorance - White
Christian Men... If you don't agree with this then I would say you are blinded...
Christianity is openly mocked, and you wouldn't notice if you wouldn't
notice... whereas other religions are so openly protected it's become comical to me.
When's the last time you felt comfortable making a joke about Islam or Judaism
compared to Christianity? Even if you wouldn't joke about any of them, you know
you'd be safe to criticize one publically, and the other 2 you'd face
consequences for. And these are the things these lunatics celebrate... they
love that another White Christian Man was removed from God's green earth...

!!! warning "These poor people"

    I'm not complaining necessarily about Christianity's lack of priviliege in the public sphere and my heart breaks for people who hate - period.... to hate someone for a difference of worldview or opinion to the point of openly celebrating their death is one of the saddest and most sickening realities I can think of.

What can I do after this? Charlie was just a regular guy. It's one thing to
have the attempted-assassination of Trump sweapt under the rug, or to brush it
off as a targeted attack against a powerful man. But Charlie wasn't a
politician... he was just a guy with a job, who went around having
conversations. The violence against the Right is stochastic in nature, but
increasingly present as public figures continue to use hitler and nazi-fueled
language against people they disagree with...

Paired so closely in time with the news of [The slaying of Iryna
Zarutska](https://www.foxnews.com/us/victim-random-train-stabbing-embraced-american-dream-could-have-taken-world-storm-neighbors-say)
who was attacked randomly by a man who, all unconfirmed allegations aside, had
been arrested 14 times for violent crimes. And yet, in my country of freedom, a
violent criminal was free to murder a refugee fleeing a war-torn region... (if
you watched any videos you'll see 4 or 5 people witness the attack, and then do
nothing as Iryna sorrowfully dies, alone and unaided in a foreign country...
the victim of a monster)

Charlie commented on this event, I have the same feelings about the climax I
thought it led to after years of under-reported race-fueld violence against
white people, and he was called a racist just for noticing patterns...

If they shot him for saying something about any of his convictions, for
believing he should be allowed to raise his family in safety, to attend church,
and to openly debate for the sake of the better idea - they'd shoot me
to... and celebrate.

I take as much comfort as possible, however minimal, knowing that Charlie loved
Jesus, and that his family has the hope of resurrection in the name of Jesus to see
him again... But 2 kids lost their dad, and a young woman lost her husband,
lunatics celebrate, today is just another day, and if someone would come for a
normal guy like Charlie, they'd come for you too.
