I have list [True, False, False, True] and another list [1, 2, 3, 4] and a use
case where I want to filter list 2 based on list 1 to remove values that line
up with the element False in list 1.... so the outcome will be [1, 4].
list(compress(list2, list1)) will do it. As long as you can create a mask for
the filter than itertool.compress will be your friend!
