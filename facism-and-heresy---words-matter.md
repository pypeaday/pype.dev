  is such a school-yard bully, low IQ,\ndesperate, degenerate move when it's used
  in lieu of data... I have 2 scenarios\nin my head that bring light to one another.\n\n!!!
  warning \"\"\n\n    Today the words \"Nazi\" and \"Facist\" are so over-used it's
  moved beyond sickening to boring.\n\nHowever, the usage of these words has led to
  violence, and a lot of it\nin my opinion. The dangerous rhetoric is a key player
  in the multiple\nTrump-assassination attempts, various acts of violence against
  other\nconservatives, specifically, (because who else does the Left call a Facist
  except\nanyone remotely moderate anymore), and most notably the murder of Charlie
  Kirk.\nI find the rhetoric super dangerous because I'm not a politician, but boy
  can I\ntell you for sure that Charlie was a moderate, and if they came for him then\nconsider
  my reflection: [[reflection-they-can-come-for-anyone]].\n\nOne of the problems I
  see here is that many people can't define \"Nazi\" or\n\"Facist\". To the Left,
  these words just describe someone they disagree with,\nand it's turning out - ultimately
  someone they think would be better off dead.\n\nIt reminds me of a kid at a summer
  camp I worked at about 10 years ago. The\ncamp was all about Christian apologetics
  - great times, good discussions, lots\nof great content, etc. One year there was
  a 17 or 18 year old boy here, super\nfundamentalist in his beliefs... no harm no
  foul here. But he demonstrated a\nhabit of calling **anything** that differ'ed from
  his interpretation of a\npassage of scripture as heresy. Now... here's the thing,
  it's not heresy to not\nbe a young-earth-creationist. But something that is true
  is that people have\nbeen **put to death** over heresy in the history of the Church....
  and yet this\nkid felt comfortable labeling anyone a heretic who was more fluent
  in Hebrew\nthan him...\n\nSo what do I see? - There's similarities between that
  immature kid and\npractically anyone using the words \"Nazi\" or \"Facist\" to describe
  American\npolitics right now - are the same type of person to me. That person feels
  a\ndeep care for the thing they think they're protecting, but in reality they're\nparticipating
  in a violent pattern of history that **they do not understand**\n\nSo to us today,
  in or out of the Church, involved or not involved with\npolitics... We need to recognize
  that words matter. And to carelessly use words\nthat eventually excuse violence
  is at best, ignorant. There's nothing wrong\nwith ignorance, but a good measure
  of a man is what he does when his ignorance\nhas been pointed out... Will you be
  apart of the solution? Or continue to fan\nthe flames?"

    letter to a friend I've been having a\nconversation with for a couple weeks</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Name-calling
    in a rhetorical exchange is such a school-yard bully, low IQ,\ndesperate, degenerate
    move when it's used in lieu of data... I have 2 scenarios\nin my head that bring
    light to one another.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition warning\">\n<p>Today the words
    &quot;Nazi&quot; and &quot;Facist&quot; are so over-used it's moved beyond sickening
    to boring.</p>\n</div>\n<p>However, the usage of these words has led to violence,
    and a lot of it\nin my opinion. The dangerous rhetoric is a key player in the
    multiple\nTrump-assassination attempts, various acts of violence against other\nconservatives,
    specifically, (because who else does the Left call a Facist except\nanyone remotely
    moderate anymore), and most notably the murder of Charlie Kirk.\nI find the rhetoric
    super dangerous because I'm not a politician, but boy can I\ntell you for sure
    that Charlie was a moderate, and if they came for him then\nconsider my reflection:
    <a class=\"wikilink\" href=\"/reflection-they-can-come-for-anyone\">reflection-they-can-come-for-anyone</a>.</p>\n<p>One
    of the problems I see here is that many people can't define &quot;Nazi&quot; or\n&quot;Facist&quot;.
    To the Left, these words just describe someone they disagree with,\nand it's turning
    out - ultimately someone they think would be better off dead.</p>\n<p>It reminds
    me of a kid at a summer camp I worked at about 10 years ago. The\ncamp was all
    about Christian apologetics - great times, good discussions, lots\nof great content,
    etc. One year there was a 17 or 18 year old boy here, super\nfundamentalist in
    his beliefs... no harm no foul here. But he demonstrated a\nhabit of calling <strong>anything</strong>
    that differ'ed from his interpretation of a\npassage of scripture as heresy. Now...
    here's the thing, it's not heresy to not\nbe a young-earth-creationist. But something
    that is true is that people have\nbeen <strong>put to death</strong> over heresy
    in the history of the Church.... and yet this\nkid felt comfortable labeling anyone
    a heretic who was more fluent in Hebrew\nthan him...</p>\n<p>So what do I see?
    - There's similarities between that immature kid and\npractically anyone using
    the words &quot;Nazi&quot; or &quot;Facist&quot; to describe American\npolitics
    right now - are the same type of person to me. That person feels a\ndeep care
    for the thing they think they're protecting, but in reality they're\nparticipating
    in a violent pattern of history that <strong>they do not understand</strong></p>\n<p>So
    to us today, in or out of the Church, involved or not involved with\npolitics...
    We need to recognize that words matter. And to carelessly use words\nthat eventually
    excuse violence is at best, ignorant. There's nothing wrong\nwith ignorance, but
    a good measure of a man is what he does when his ignorance\nhas been pointed out...
    Will you be apart of the solution? Or continue to fan\nthe flames?</p>\n\n    </section>\n</article>

    letter to a friend I've been having a\nconversation with for a couple weeks</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Name-calling
    in a rhetorical exchange is such a school-yard bully, low IQ,\ndesperate, degenerate
    move when it's used in lieu of data... I have 2 scenarios\nin my head that bring
    light to one another.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition warning\">\n<p>Today the words
    &quot;Nazi&quot; and &quot;Facist&quot; are so over-used it's moved beyond sickening
    to boring.</p>\n</div>\n<p>However, the usage of these words has led to violence,
    and a lot of it\nin my opinion. The dangerous rhetoric is a key player in the
    multiple\nTrump-assassination attempts, various acts of violence against other\nconservatives,
    specifically, (because who else does the Left call a Facist except\nanyone remotely
    moderate anymore), and most notably the murder of Charlie Kirk.\nI find the rhetoric
    super dangerous because I'm not a politician, but boy can I\ntell you for sure
    that Charlie was a moderate, and if they came for him then\nconsider my reflection:
    <a class=\"wikilink\" href=\"/reflection-they-can-come-for-anyone\">reflection-they-can-come-for-anyone</a>.</p>\n<p>One
    of the problems I see here is that many people can't define &quot;Nazi&quot; or\n&quot;Facist&quot;.
    To the Left, these words just describe someone they disagree with,\nand it's turning
    out - ultimately someone they think would be better off dead.</p>\n<p>It reminds
    me of a kid at a summer camp I worked at about 10 years ago. The\ncamp was all
    about Christian apologetics - great times, good discussions, lots\nof great content,
    etc. One year there was a 17 or 18 year old boy here, super\nfundamentalist in
    his beliefs... no harm no foul here. But he demonstrated a\nhabit of calling <strong>anything</strong>
    that differ'ed from his interpretation of a\npassage of scripture as heresy. Now...
    here's the thing, it's not heresy to not\nbe a young-earth-creationist. But something
    that is true is that people have\nbeen <strong>put to death</strong> over heresy
    in the history of the Church.... and yet this\nkid felt comfortable labeling anyone
    a heretic who was more fluent in Hebrew\nthan him...</p>\n<p>So what do I see?
    - There's similarities between that immature kid and\npractically anyone using
    the words &quot;Nazi&quot; or &quot;Facist&quot; to describe American\npolitics
    right now - are the same type of person to me. That person feels a\ndeep care
    for the thing they think they're protecting, but in reality they're\nparticipating
    in a violent pattern of history that <strong>they do not understand</strong></p>\n<p>So
    to us today, in or out of the Church, involved or not involved with\npolitics...
    We need to recognize that words matter. And to carelessly use words\nthat eventually
    excuse violence is at best, ignorant. There's nothing wrong\nwith ignorance, but
    a good measure of a man is what he does when his ignorance\nhas been pointed out...
    Will you be apart of the solution? Or continue to fan\nthe flames?</p>\n\n    </section>\n</article>"

Name-calling in a rhetorical exchange is such a school-yard bully, low IQ,
desperate, degenerate move when it's used in lieu of data... I have 2 scenarios
in my head that bring light to one another.

!!! warning ""

    Today the words "Nazi" and "Facist" are so over-used it's moved beyond sickening to boring.

However, the usage of these words has led to violence, and a lot of it
in my opinion. The dangerous rhetoric is a key player in the multiple
Trump-assassination attempts, various acts of violence against other
conservatives, specifically, (because who else does the Left call a Facist except
anyone remotely moderate anymore), and most notably the murder of Charlie Kirk.
I find the rhetoric super dangerous because I'm not a politician, but boy can I
tell you for sure that Charlie was a moderate, and if they came for him then
consider my reflection: [[reflection-they-can-come-for-anyone]].

One of the problems I see here is that many people can't define "Nazi" or
"Facist". To the Left, these words just describe someone they disagree with,
and it's turning out - ultimately someone they think would be better off dead.

It reminds me of a kid at a summer camp I worked at about 10 years ago. The
camp was all about Christian apologetics - great times, good discussions, lots
of great content, etc. One year there was a 17 or 18 year old boy here, super
fundamentalist in his beliefs... no harm no foul here. But he demonstrated a
habit of calling **anything** that differ'ed from his interpretation of a
passage of scripture as heresy. Now... here's the thing, it's not heresy to not
be a young-earth-creationist. But something that is true is that people have
been **put to death** over heresy in the history of the Church.... and yet this
kid felt comfortable labeling anyone a heretic who was more fluent in Hebrew
than him...

So what do I see? - There's similarities between that immature kid and
practically anyone using the words "Nazi" or "Facist" to describe American
politics right now - are the same type of person to me. That person feels a
deep care for the thing they think they're protecting, but in reality they're
participating in a violent pattern of history that **they do not understand**

So to us today, in or out of the Church, involved or not involved with
politics... We need to recognize that words matter. And to carelessly use words
that eventually excuse violence is at best, ignorant. There's nothing wrong
with ignorance, but a good measure of a man is what he does when his ignorance
has been pointed out... Will you be apart of the solution? Or continue to fan
the flames?
