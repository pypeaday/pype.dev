    <p>I went to sit down this morning with a cup of coffee and do a meditation like I
try to do at least a few times a week. I meditate on the Bible, on God's word
because I believe it is God's word - and what a shallow belief it'd be if I
knew nothing about the Word. For the last few years this has been the normal
way I spend time with Jesus, and he has brought comfort and guidance to me, not
through new knowledge necessarily, but through perspective and wisdom.</p>
<p>This feels almost like a lazy way out of hardened theological study, a practice
I hope to come back to before too long, but through semi-regular reflection,
meditation, and writing Jesus has done a lot of good to my heart.</p>
<p>I hope it wouldn't take years of the Lord's work on my heart to recognize the
blessing in my life, but left to my own devices I certainly look at what he's
given me and still desire more. So, that wish is certainly nothing more than a
fancy - and praise God for that, because it only further shows my need for him.
He works on me every day and by God's grace the blessings in my life are pretty
flipping clear.</p>
<p>The passage I was going to meditate on this morning was 2 Corinthians 1:5</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">2 Corinthians 1:5</p>
<p>For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow to us, thus through Christ our comfort overflows also.</p>
</div>
<p>By God's grace, &quot;suffering&quot;&quot; isn't something I feel very &quot;connected to&quot; - it's
not something I feel a deep current need to meditate on (right now). I have been
brought through many trials, just like a lot of people, and my story isn't full
of only stupendous highs, but I do feel like it's a bit easier for me today to
resonate with Paul's words in Romans 8.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Romans 8:18</p>
<p>For I consider that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that is about to be revealed to us.</p>
</div>
<p>In God's good grace on my life he is showing me day by day the glory that will
be revealed. He shows me through daily blessing of work - where my family is
more-than-provided for via gifts and talents he's given me. He shows me through
my family, who love me in my mistakes and celebrate my wins. He shows me
through my wife specifically, who wants my holiness more than my happiness but
in that support she often increases both.</p>
<p>There are sufferings in my life that Jesus has used as a means to bring comfort
to others - I think that's one of the points of the larger 2 Corinthians
passage. However, in that same breath in the quietness of my office with this
cup of mushroom-coffee, I can say that the sufferings he's brought me through
pale in comparison to just the glory he has already revealed to me, and that
means the glory &quot;that is about to be revealed&quot; can be only greater.</p>
<p>The blessing of the Lord on my life and family is beyond insane. And my prayer
is just that I (and my family) would see it. This is on my mind because of a
simple event the other day - an interview and job-offer. I didn't take this
job, if you're new here I'm in <a class="wikilink" href="/cat-autonomy-2-0">cat-autonomy-2-0</a> (a story of its own filled
with divine grace and provision). However, getting a job isn't exactly an easy
thing right now - and in the Lord's blessing on my life I've had multiple
opportunities. I mentioned the offer to my wife and her only response was &quot;The
Lord is too good to us&quot;. And she's right - he is.</p>
<p>Praise God for blessings, and praise him for sufferings. I pray today for
myself he keeps my eyes and heart focused on what I can do with excellence and
for his glory. I also pray for continued blessing and favor - it isn't a sin to
want things to be going well... May God bring peace and favor to anyone reading
this - favor through adoption and peace through the strength and power of the
creator-God.</p>
