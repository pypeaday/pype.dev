Spurgeon's "Morning and Evening" today ended with a poem:

```
Trials make the promise sweet;
Trials give new life to prayer;
Trials bring me to his feet,
Lay me low, and keep me there.
```

Trials forge and reveal faith in our lives - faith in something that is...
Yahweh uses trials as a megaphone to his people though. For those called into
his family, the trials of temporary life should, and for the true believer
'do', bring us closer to the King's throne. The trial highlights a larger
reality of existential need of a savior. Trials have severity because there are
different kinds, but the need for a King is of one kind. It is the highest and
most necessary need of us all, but not everyone knows it. Trials can reveal it.

Praise the Lord for trials that bring us closer to him, for no trial of earth
can compare to the Glory of the King.
