  to completion on the seventh day in Genesis 1. It is the only day that\ndoes not
  end with 'there evening and there was morning, the Nth day'\n\nHumans were meant
  to rest with God in his creation forever, but in their\nrebllion they are sentenced
  to work as slaves to the land. The rest of the\nhsitory of God's people consists
  of them looking for God's rest, but\nconsistently falling back into slavery/(fallen)
  work.\n\n## Sabbath\n\nCelebated every week on the 7th day. The idea is to live
  in the eternal rest that God offered in creation.\n\n## Jubilee\n\nEvery 7 * 7 years
  is the Ultimate Sabbath - the land is reset (or was supposed\nto be), everything
  was returned to the original owner, debt does not persist -\neverything resets so
  everyone can rest.\n\n# Jesus\n\nJesus calls himself the Lord of the Sabbath. He
  claimed to bring the ultimate\nrest of God. Jesus was crucified at a specific time
  - on Good Friday, and he\nrose again on the following Sunday... which is the first
  day of the next week\n_or_ the 8th day... the first day of a new age, a new rest,
  God's ultimate\nsabbath that is symbolized in the 7th day of creation.\n\n# Questions\n\n!!!
  note \"1\"\n\n    How does the author of Genesis conclude each of the seven days
  of creation?\n    Consider the seventh day of creation as an ultimate rest day.
  What do you\n    think it would be like to always live in that rest with God?\n\n!!!
  Scripture \"Genesis 1:5,8,13,19,23,31; 2:1-3 5\"\n\n    5God called the light day,
  and the darkness He called night. And there was\n    evening and there was morning,
  one day.\n\n    8God called the expanse heaven. And there was evening and there
  was\n    morning, a second day.\n\n    13There was evening and there was morning,
  a third day.\n\n    19There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.\n\n
  \   23There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.\n\n    31God saw all
  that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was\n    evening and there
  was morning, the sixth day.\n\n    The Creation of Man and Woman\n\n    1Thus the
  heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. 2By\n    the seventh
  day God completed His work which He had done, and He rested on\n    the seventh
  day from all His work which He had done. 3Then God blessed the\n    seventh day
  and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work\n    which God had
  created and made.\n\nI imagine it would've looked a lot like enjoying the creation...
  I work at\nthings I love, and that can be restful to me - I find purpose and order
  in my\nhobbies and so I bet life would be like that. The work woudl be productive
  but\nnot toilsome.\n\n\n!!! note \"2\"\n\n    Read Genesis 3:1-7 and 3:21-24 What
  were the humans tempted to believe\n    about God and themselves? How did they act
  on these beliefs, and how did\n    this choice exile them from the place of rest?
  How do you think lies about\n    God and ourselves prevent us from resting with
  God today?\n\n!!! scripture \"Genesis 3:1-7,21-24\"\n\n    The Fall of Man\n\n    1Now
  the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord\n    God
  had made. And he said to the woman, \u201CIndeed, has God said, \u2018You shall\n
  \   not eat from any tree of the garden\u2019?\u201D 2The woman said to the serpent,\n
  \   \u201CFrom the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; 3but from the fruit\n
  \   of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, \u2018You shall\n
  \   not eat from it or touch it, or you will die.\u2019\u2009\u201D 4The serpent
  said to the\n    woman, \u201CYou surely will not die! 5For God knows that in the
  day you eat\n    from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing
  good\n    and evil.\u201D 6When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
  that it\n    was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make
  one\n    wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband\n
  \   with her, and he ate. 7Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they\n
  \   knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made\n    themselves
  loin coverings. \n\n    21The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam\n    and his
  wife, and clothed them. 22Then the Lord God said, \u201CBehold, the man\n    has
  become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might stretch\n    out
  his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live\n    forever\u201D\u2014
  23therefore the Lord God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to\n    cultivate
  the ground from which he was taken. 24So He drove the man out;\n    and at the east
  of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the\n    flaming sword which
  turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of\n    life.\n\nHumans are
  templted to believe that God is witholding desirableble information\nthey are templted
  to _be like God_. They are templted to believe that they\nwould be right to knowing
  good and evil (ironic since they know it's bad to eat\nof the Tree of Knowledge
  anyways)\n\nThey acted by listening to the serpent, and to themselves... essentially
  they\nchose to not listen and adhere to Yahweh. This choice represents stark and\nobvious
  rebellion. Yahweh, I think, sees that his creation are tempted to go\ntheir own
  way, and for their own protection exiles them from the Garden.\n\nIt seems like
  lies haven't changed; ultimately we are still tempted to define\ngood and evil/bad
  for ourselves. I take action by defining wicked things as\ngood - made obvious by
  the fact that I choose to sin often, choose to not\nlisten to Yahweh. Actively listening
  to myself is exhausting. I think there's a\nlot to discussing \"God's rest\", but
  a high and almost trivial level, I am\nsimply less tired when my life is more in
  step with God's definitions of good\nand bad\n\n!!! note \"3\"\n\n    God wants
  to restore humanity to ultimate rest, so he chooses the\n    Israelites to reenact
  his seventh-day rest so they can share it with\n    others. Of all the ways he invites
  them to practice rest which practice are\n    you least familiar with today?\n\n!!!
  scripture \"Exodus 20:8-11\"\n\n    8\u201CRemember the sabbath day, to keep it
  holy. 9Six days you shall labor and\n    do all your work, 10but the seventh day
  is a sabbath of the Lord your God;\n    in it you shall not do any work, you or
  your son or your daughter, your\n    male or your female servant or your cattle
  or your sojourner who stays with\n    you. 11For in six days the Lord made the heavens
  and the earth, the sea and\n    all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day;
  therefore the Lord\n    blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.\n\n!!! scripture
  \"Leviticus 23:1-3; 25:8-13\"\n\n    Laws of Religious Festivals\n\n    1The Lord
  spoke again to Moses, saying, 2\u201CSpeak to the sons of Israel and\n    say to
  them, \u2018The Lord\u2019s appointed times which you shall proclaim as holy\n    convocations\u2014My
  appointed times are these:\n\n    3\u2018For six days work may be done, but on the
  seventh day there is a sabbath\n    of complete rest, a holy convocation. You shall
  not do any work; it is a\n    sabbath to the Lord in all your dwellings.\n\n    8\u2018You
  are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven\n    times seven
  years, so that you have the time of the seven sabbaths of\n    years, namely, forty-nine
  years. 9You shall then sound a ram\u2019s horn abroad\n    on the tenth day of the
  seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall\n    sound a horn all through your
  land. 10You shall thus consecrate the\n    fiftieth year and proclaim a release
  through the land to all its\n    inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, and
  each of you shall return to\n    his own property, and each of you shall return
  to his family. 11You shall\n    have the fiftieth year as a jubilee; you shall not
  sow, nor reap its\n    aftergrowth, nor gather in from its untrimmed vines. 12For
  it is a jubilee;\n    it shall be holy to you. You shall eat its crops out of the
  field.\n\n    13\u2018On this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his own
  property.\n\n\n!!! note \"4\"\n\n    Jesus comes to restore us to God\u2019s eternal
  rest! How does Jesus launch his\n    public ministry? Read Luke 4:14-21, noting
  that the year of favor refers to\n    the ultimate Jubilee\u2014Israel\u2019s super-charged
  Sabbath \n\n    What do you observe?\n\n!!! scripture \"Luke 4:14-21\"\n\n    Jesus\u2019
  Public Ministry\n\n    14And Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit,
  and news about\n    Him spread through all the surrounding district. 15And He began
  teaching in\n    their synagogues and was praised by all.\n\n    16And He came to
  Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and as was His\n    custom, He entered the
  synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read.\n    17And the book of the prophet
  Isaiah was handed to Him. And He opened the\n    book and found the place where
  it was written,\n\n    18\u201CThe Spirit of the Lord is upon Me,\n\n    Because
  He anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor.\n\n    He has sent Me to proclaim
  release to the captives,\n\n    And recovery of sight to the blind,\n\n    To set
  free those who are oppressed,\n\n    19To proclaim the favorable year of the Lord.\u201D\n\n
  \   20And He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant and sat down; and\n
  \   the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him. 21And He began to say\n
  \   to them, \u201CToday this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.\u201D\n\n!!!
  scripture \"Leviticus 25\"\n\n    The Sabbatic Year and Year of Jubilee\n\n    1The
  Lord then spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, saying, 2\u201CSpeak to the sons\n    of
  Israel and say to them, \u2018When you come into the land which I shall give\n    you,
  then the land shall have a sabbath to the Lord. 3Six years you shall\n    sow your
  field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in\n    its crop,
  4but during the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath rest,\n    a sabbath
  to the Lord; you shall not sow your field nor prune your\n    vineyard. 5Your harvest\u2019s
  aftergrowth you shall not reap, and your grapes\n    of untrimmed vines you shall
  not gather; the land shall have a sabbatical\n    year. 6All of you shall have the
  sabbath products of the land for food;\n    yourself, and your male and female slaves,
  and your hired man and your\n    foreign resident, those who live as aliens with
  you. 7Even your cattle and\n    the animals that are in your land shall have all
  its crops to eat.\n\n    8\u2018You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years
  for yourself, seven\n    times seven years, so that you have the time of the seven
  sabbaths of\n    years, namely, forty-nine years. 9You shall then sound a ram\u2019s
  horn abroad\n    on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement
  you shall\n    sound a horn all through your land. 10You shall thus consecrate the\n
  \   fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its\n    inhabitants.
  It shall be a jubilee for you, and each of you shall return to\n    his own property,
  and each of you shall return to his family. 11You shall\n    have the fiftieth year
  as a jubilee; you shall not sow, nor reap its\n    aftergrowth, nor gather in from
  its untrimmed vines. 12For it is a jubilee;\n    it shall be holy to you. You shall
  eat its crops out of the field.\n\n    13\u2018On this year of jubilee each of you
  shall return to his own property.\n    14If you make a sale, moreover, to your friend
  or buy from your friend\u2019s\n    hand, you shall not wrong one another. 15Corresponding
  to the number of\n    years after the jubilee, you shall buy from your friend; he
  is to sell to\n    you according to the number of years of crops. 16In proportion
  to the\n    extent of the years you shall increase its price, and in proportion
  to the\n    fewness of the years you shall diminish its price, for it is a number
  of\n    crops he is selling to you. 17So you shall not wrong one another, but you\n
  \   shall fear your God; for I am the Lord your God.\n\n    18\u2018You shall thus
  observe My statutes and keep My judgments, so as to carry\n    them out, that you
  may live securely on the land. 19Then the land will\n    yield its produce, so that
  you can eat your fill and live securely on it.\n    20But if you say, \u201CWhat
  are we going to eat on the seventh year if we do\n    not sow or gather in our crops?\u201D
  21then I will so order My blessing for you\n    in the sixth year that it will bring
  forth the crop for three years. 22When\n    you are sowing the eighth year, you
  can still eat old things from the crop,\n    eating the old until the ninth year
  when its crop comes in.\n\n    The Law of Redemption\n\n    23\u2018The land, moreover,
  shall not be sold permanently, for the land is Mine;\n    for you are but aliens
  and sojourners with Me. 24Thus for every piece of\n    your property, you are to
  provide for the redemption of the land.\n\n    25\u2018If a fellow countryman of
  yours becomes so poor he has to sell part of\n    his property, then his nearest
  kinsman is to come and buy back what his\n    relative has sold. 26Or in case a
  man has no kinsman, but so recovers his\n    means as to find sufficient for its
  redemption, 27then he shall calculate\n    the years since its sale and refund the
  balance to the man to whom he sold\n    it, and so return to his property. 28But
  if he has not found sufficient\n    means to get it back for himself, then what
  he has sold shall remain in the\n    hands of its purchaser until the year of jubilee;
  but at the jubilee it\n    shall revert, that he may return to his property.\n\n
  \   29\u2018Likewise, if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then his\n
  \   redemption right remains valid until a full year from its sale; his right\n
  \   of redemption lasts a full year. 30But if it is not bought back for him\n    within
  the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city\n    passes
  permanently to its purchaser throughout his generations; it does not\n    revert
  in the jubilee. 31The houses of the villages, however, which have no\n    surrounding
  wall shall be considered as open fields; they have redemption\n    rights and revert
  in the jubilee. 32As for cities of the Levites, the\n    Levites have a permanent
  right of redemption for the houses of the cities\n    which are their possession.
  33What, therefore, belongs to the Levites may\n    be redeemed and a house sale
  in the city of this possession reverts in the\n    jubilee, for the houses of the
  cities of the Levites are their possession\n    among the sons of Israel. 34But
  pasture fields of their cities shall not be\n    sold, for that is their perpetual
  possession.\n\n    Of Poor Countrymen\n\n    35\u2018Now in case a countryman of
  yours becomes poor and his means with regard\n    to you falter, then you are to
  sustain him, like a stranger or a sojourner,\n    that he may live with you. 36Do
  not take usurious interest from him, but\n    revere your God, that your countryman
  may live with you. 37You shall not\n    give him your silver at interest, nor your
  food for gain. 38I am the Lord\n    your God, who brought you out of the land of
  Egypt to give you the land of\n    Canaan and to be your God.\n\n    39\u2018If
  a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he\n    sells himself
  to you, you shall not subject him to a slave\u2019s service. 40He\n    shall be
  with you as a hired man, as if he were a sojourner; he shall serve\n    with you
  until the year of jubilee. 41He shall then go out from you, he and\n    his sons
  with him, and shall go back to his family, that he may return to\n    the property
  of his forefathers. 42For they are My servants whom I brought\n    out from the
  land of Egypt; they are not to be sold in a slave sale. 43You\n    shall not rule
  over him with severity, but are to revere your God. 44As for\n    your male and
  female slaves whom you may have\u2014you may acquire male and\n    female slaves
  from the pagan nations that are around you. 45Then, too, it\n    is out of the sons
  of the sojourners who live as aliens among you that you\n    may gain acquisition,
  and out of their families who are with you, whom they\n    will have produced in
  your land; they also may become your possession.\n    46You may even bequeath them
  to your sons after you, to receive as a\n    possession; you can use them as permanent
  slaves. But in respect to your\n    countrymen, the sons of Israel, you shall not
  rule with severity over one\n    another.\n\n    Of Redeeming a Poor Man\n\n    47\u2018Now
  if the means of a stranger or of a sojourner with you becomes\n    sufficient, and
  a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to him as\n    to sell himself
  to a stranger who is sojourning with you, or to the\n    descendants of a stranger\u2019s
  family, 48then he shall have redemption right\n    after he has been sold. One of
  his brothers may redeem him, 49or his uncle,\n    or his uncle\u2019s son, may redeem
  him, or one of his blood relatives from his\n    family may redeem him; or if he
  prospers, he may redeem himself. 50He then\n    with his purchaser shall calculate
  from the year when he sold himself to\n    him up to the year of jubilee; and the
  price of his sale shall correspond\n    to the number of years. It is like the days
  of a hired man that he shall be\n    with him. 51If there are still many years,
  he shall refund part of his\n    purchase price in proportion to them for his own
  redemption; 52and if few\n    years remain until the year of jubilee, he shall so
  calculate with him. In\n    proportion to his years he is to refund the amount for
  his redemption.\n    53Like a man hired year by year he shall be with him; he shall
  not rule\n    over him with severity in your sight. 54Even if he is not redeemed
  by these\n    means, he shall still go out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons
  with\n    him. 55For the sons of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom
  I\n    brought out from the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.\n\n\n!!! note
  \"5\"\n\n    What is one specific way Jesus invites us to receive and practice true
  rest\n\n!!! scripture \"Matthew 11:28-29\"\n\n    28\u201CCome to Me, all who are
  weary and heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.\n    29Take My yoke upon you and
  learn from Me, for I am gentle and humble in\n    heart, and you will find rest
  for your souls."

    1:5,8,13,19,23,31; 2:1-3 5</p>\n<p>5God called the light day, and the darkness
    He called night. And there was\nevening and there was morning, one day.</p>\n<p>8God

    done, and He rested on\nthe seventh day from all His work which He had done. 3Then
    God blessed the\nseventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all
    His work\nwhich God had created and made.</p>\n</div>\n<p>I imagine it would've

    How did they act on these beliefs, and how did\nthis choice exile them from the
    place of rest? How do you think lies about\nGod and ourselves prevent us from
    resting with God today?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Genesis 3:1-7,21-24</p>\n<p>The Fall of Man</p>\n<p>1Now
    the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord\nGod had
    made. And he said to the woman, \u201CIndeed, has God said, \u2018You shall\nnot
    eat from any tree of the garden\u2019?\u201D 2The woman said to the serpent,\n\u201CFrom
    the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; 3but from the fruit\nof the tree
    which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, \u2018You shall\nnot eat from
    it or touch it, or you will die.\u2019\u2009\u201D 4The serpent said to the\nwoman,
    \u201CYou surely will not die! 5For God knows that in the day you eat\nfrom it
    your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good\nand evil.\u201D
    6When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it\nwas a delight
    to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one\nwise, she took from
    its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband\nwith her, and he ate. 7Then
    the eyes of both of them were opened, and they\nknew that they were naked; and
    they sewed fig leaves together and made\nthemselves loin coverings.</p>\n<p>21The
    Lord God made garments of skin for Adam\nand his wife, and clothed them. 22Then
    the Lord God said, \u201CBehold, the man\nhas become like one of Us, knowing good
    and evil; and now, he might stretch\nout his hand, and take also from the tree
    of life, and eat, and live\nforever\u201D\u2014 23therefore the Lord God sent
    him out from the garden of Eden, to\ncultivate the ground from which he was taken.
    24So He drove the man out;\nand at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed
    the cherubim and the\nflaming sword which turned every direction to guard the
    way to the tree of\nlife.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Humans are templted to believe that
    God is witholding desirableble information\nthey are templted to <em>be like God</em>.
    They are templted to believe that they\nwould be right to knowing good and evil
    (ironic since they know it's bad to eat\nof the Tree of Knowledge anyways)</p>\n<p>They
    acted by listening to the serpent, and to themselves... essentially they\nchose
    to not listen and adhere to Yahweh. This choice represents stark and\nobvious
    rebellion. Yahweh, I think, sees that his creation are tempted to go\ntheir own
    way, and for their own protection exiles them from the Garden.</p>\n<p>It seems
    like lies haven't changed; ultimately we are still tempted to define\ngood and
    evil/bad for ourselves. I take action by defining wicked things as\ngood - made
    obvious by the fact that I choose to sin often, choose to not\nlisten to Yahweh.
    Actively listening to myself is exhausting. I think there's a\nlot to discussing
    &quot;God's rest&quot;, but a high and almost trivial level, I am\nsimply less
    tired when my life is more in step with God's definitions of good\nand bad</p>\n<div

    where He had been brought up; and as was His\ncustom, He entered the synagogue
    on the Sabbath, and stood up to read.\n17And the book of the prophet Isaiah was
    handed to Him. And He opened the\nbook and found the place where it was written,</p>\n<p>18\u201CThe
    Spirit of the Lord is upon Me,</p>\n<p>Because He anointed Me to preach the gospel
    to the poor.</p>\n<p>He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives,</p>\n<p>And
    recovery of sight to the blind,</p>\n<p>To set free those who are oppressed,</p>\n<p>19To
    proclaim the favorable year of the Lord.\u201D</p>\n<p>20And He closed the book,
    gave it back to the attendant and sat down; and\nthe eyes of all in the synagogue
    were fixed on Him. 21And He began to say\nto them, \u201CToday this Scripture
    has been fulfilled in your hearing.\u201D</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition
    scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Leviticus 25</p>\n<p>The Sabbatic
    Year and Year of Jubilee</p>\n<p>1The Lord then spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai,
    saying, 2\u201CSpeak to the sons\nof Israel and say to them, \u2018When you come
    into the land which I shall give\nyou, then the land shall have a sabbath to the
    Lord. 3Six years you shall\nsow your field, and six years you shall prune your
    vineyard and gather in\nits crop, 4but during the seventh year the land shall
    have a sabbath rest,\na sabbath to the Lord; you shall not sow your field nor
    prune your\nvineyard. 5Your harvest\u2019s aftergrowth you shall not reap, and
    your grapes\nof untrimmed vines you shall not gather; the land shall have a sabbatical\nyear.
    6All of you shall have the sabbath products of the land for food;\nyourself, and
    your male and female slaves, and your hired man and your\nforeign resident, those
    who live as aliens with you. 7Even your cattle and\nthe animals that are in your
    land shall have all its crops to eat.</p>\n<p>8\u2018You are also to count off
    seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven\ntimes seven years, so that you have
    the time of the seven sabbaths of\nyears, namely, forty-nine years. 9You shall
    then sound a ram\u2019s horn abroad\non the tenth day of the seventh month; on
    the day of atonement you shall\nsound a horn all through your land. 10You shall
    thus consecrate the\nfiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to
    all its\ninhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, and each of you shall return
    to\nhis own property, and each of you shall return to his family. 11You shall\nhave
    the fiftieth year as a jubilee; you shall not sow, nor reap its\naftergrowth,
    nor gather in from its untrimmed vines. 12For it is a jubilee;\nit shall be holy
    to you. You shall eat its crops out of the field.</p>\n<p>13\u2018On this year
    of jubilee each of you shall return to his own property.\n14If you make a sale,
    moreover, to your friend or buy from your friend\u2019s\nhand, you shall not wrong
    one another. 15Corresponding to the number of\nyears after the jubilee, you shall
    buy from your friend; he is to sell to\nyou according to the number of years of
    crops. 16In proportion to the\nextent of the years you shall increase its price,
    and in proportion to the\nfewness of the years you shall diminish its price, for
    it is a number of\ncrops he is selling to you. 17So you shall not wrong one another,
    but you\nshall fear your God; for I am the Lord your God.</p>\n<p>18\u2018You
    shall thus observe My statutes and keep My judgments, so as to carry\nthem out,
    that you may live securely on the land. 19Then the land will\nyield its produce,
    so that you can eat your fill and live securely on it.\n20But if you say, \u201CWhat
    are we going to eat on the seventh year if we do\nnot sow or gather in our crops?\u201D
    21then I will so order My blessing for you\nin the sixth year that it will bring
    forth the crop for three years. 22When\nyou are sowing the eighth year, you can
    still eat old things from the crop,\neating the old until the ninth year when
    its crop comes in.</p>\n<p>The Law of Redemption</p>\n<p>23\u2018The land, moreover,
    shall not be sold permanently, for the land is Mine;\nfor you are but aliens and
    sojourners with Me. 24Thus for every piece of\nyour property, you are to provide
    for the redemption of the land.</p>\n<p>25\u2018If a fellow countryman of yours
    becomes so poor he has to sell part of\nhis property, then his nearest kinsman
    is to come and buy back what his\nrelative has sold. 26Or in case a man has no
    kinsman, but so recovers his\nmeans as to find sufficient for its redemption,
    27then he shall calculate\nthe years since its sale and refund the balance to
    the man to whom he sold\nit, and so return to his property. 28But if he has not
    found sufficient\nmeans to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall
    remain in the\nhands of its purchaser until the year of jubilee; but at the jubilee
    it\nshall revert, that he may return to his property.</p>\n<p>29\u2018Likewise,
    if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then his\nredemption right remains
    valid until a full year from its sale; his right\nof redemption lasts a full year.
    30But if it is not bought back for him\nwithin the space of a full year, then
    the house that is in the walled city\npasses permanently to its purchaser throughout
    his generations; it does not\nrevert in the jubilee. 31The houses of the villages,
    however, which have no\nsurrounding wall shall be considered as open fields; they
    have redemption\nrights and revert in the jubilee. 32As for cities of the Levites,
    the\nLevites have a permanent right of redemption for the houses of the cities\nwhich
    are their possession. 33What, therefore, belongs to the Levites may\nbe redeemed
    and a house sale in the city of this possession reverts in the\njubilee, for the
    houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession\namong the sons of Israel.
    34But pasture fields of their cities shall not be\nsold, for that is their perpetual
    possession.</p>\n<p>Of Poor Countrymen</p>\n<p>35\u2018Now in case a countryman
    of yours becomes poor and his means with regard\nto you falter, then you are to
    sustain him, like a stranger or a sojourner,\nthat he may live with you. 36Do
    not take usurious interest from him, but\nrevere your God, that your countryman
    may live with you. 37You shall not\ngive him your silver at interest, nor your
    food for gain. 38I am the Lord\nyour God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt
    to give you the land of\nCanaan and to be your God.</p>\n<p>39\u2018If a countryman
    of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he\nsells himself to you, you
    shall not subject him to a slave\u2019s service. 40He\nshall be with you as a
    hired man, as if he were a sojourner; he shall serve\nwith you until the year
    of jubilee. 41He shall then go out from you, he and\nhis sons with him, and shall
    go back to his family, that he may return to\nthe property of his forefathers.
    42For they are My servants whom I brought\nout from the land of Egypt; they are
    not to be sold in a slave sale. 43You\nshall not rule over him with severity,
    but are to revere your God. 44As for\nyour male and female slaves whom you may
    have\u2014you may acquire male and\nfemale slaves from the pagan nations that
    are around you. 45Then, too, it\nis out of the sons of the sojourners who live
    as aliens among you that you\nmay gain acquisition, and out of their families
    who are with you, whom they\nwill have produced in your land; they also may become
    your possession.\n46You may even bequeath them to your sons after you, to receive
    as a\npossession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to your\ncountrymen,
    the sons of Israel, you shall not rule with severity over one\nanother.</p>\n<p>Of
    Redeeming a Poor Man</p>\n<p>47\u2018Now if the means of a stranger or of a sojourner
    with you becomes\nsufficient, and a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard
    to him as\nto sell himself to a stranger who is sojourning with you, or to the\ndescendants
    of a stranger\u2019s family, 48then he shall have redemption right\nafter he has
    been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him, 49or his uncle,\nor his uncle\u2019s
    son, may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives from his\nfamily may redeem
    him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself. 50He then\nwith his purchaser shall
    calculate from the year when he sold himself to\nhim up to the year of jubilee;
    and the price of his sale shall correspond\nto the number of years. It is like
    the days of a hired man that he shall be\nwith him. 51If there are still many
    years, he shall refund part of his\npurchase price in proportion to them for his
    own redemption; 52and if few\nyears remain until the year of jubilee, he shall
    so calculate with him. In\nproportion to his years he is to refund the amount
    for his redemption.\n53Like a man hired year by year he shall be with him; he
    shall not rule\nover him with severity in your sight. 54Even if he is not redeemed
    by these\nmeans, he shall still go out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons
    with\nhim. 55For the sons of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom
    I\nbrought out from the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.</p>\n</div>\n<div

    the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord\nGod had
    made. And he said to the woman, \u201CIndeed, has God said, \u2018You shall\nnot
    eat from any tree of the garden\u2019?\u201D 2The woman said to the serpent,\n\u201CFrom
    the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; 3but from the fruit\nof the tree
    which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, \u2018You shall\nnot eat from
    it or touch it, or you will die.\u2019\u2009\u201D 4The serpent said to the\nwoman,
    \u201CYou surely will not die! 5For God knows that in the day you eat\nfrom it
    your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good\nand evil.\u201D
    6When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it\nwas a delight
    to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one\nwise, she took from
    its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband\nwith her, and he ate. 7Then
    the eyes of both of them were opened, and they\nknew that they were naked; and
    they sewed fig leaves together and made\nthemselves loin coverings.</p>\n<p>21The
    Lord God made garments of skin for Adam\nand his wife, and clothed them. 22Then
    the Lord God said, \u201CBehold, the man\nhas become like one of Us, knowing good
    and evil; and now, he might stretch\nout his hand, and take also from the tree
    of life, and eat, and live\nforever\u201D\u2014 23therefore the Lord God sent
    him out from the garden of Eden, to\ncultivate the ground from which he was taken.
    24So He drove the man out;\nand at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed
    the cherubim and the\nflaming sword which turned every direction to guard the
    way to the tree of\nlife.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Humans are templted to believe that
    God is witholding desirableble information\nthey are templted to <em>be like God</em>.
    They are templted to believe that they\nwould be right to knowing good and evil
    (ironic since they know it's bad to eat\nof the Tree of Knowledge anyways)</p>\n<p>They
    acted by listening to the serpent, and to themselves... essentially they\nchose
    to not listen and adhere to Yahweh. This choice represents stark and\nobvious
    rebellion. Yahweh, I think, sees that his creation are tempted to go\ntheir own
    way, and for their own protection exiles them from the Garden.</p>\n<p>It seems
    like lies haven't changed; ultimately we are still tempted to define\ngood and
    evil/bad for ourselves. I take action by defining wicked things as\ngood - made
    obvious by the fact that I choose to sin often, choose to not\nlisten to Yahweh.
    Actively listening to myself is exhausting. I think there's a\nlot to discussing
    &quot;God's rest&quot;, but a high and almost trivial level, I am\nsimply less
    tired when my life is more in step with God's definitions of good\nand bad</p>\n<div

    Year and Year of Jubilee</p>\n<p>1The Lord then spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai,
    saying, 2\u201CSpeak to the sons\nof Israel and say to them, \u2018When you come
    into the land which I shall give\nyou, then the land shall have a sabbath to the
    Lord. 3Six years you shall\nsow your field, and six years you shall prune your
    vineyard and gather in\nits crop, 4but during the seventh year the land shall
    have a sabbath rest,\na sabbath to the Lord; you shall not sow your field nor
    prune your\nvineyard. 5Your harvest\u2019s aftergrowth you shall not reap, and
    your grapes\nof untrimmed vines you shall not gather; the land shall have a sabbatical\nyear.
    6All of you shall have the sabbath products of the land for food;\nyourself, and
    your male and female slaves, and your hired man and your\nforeign resident, those
    who live as aliens with you. 7Even your cattle and\nthe animals that are in your
    land shall have all its crops to eat.</p>\n<p>8\u2018You are also to count off
    seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven\ntimes seven years, so that you have
    the time of the seven sabbaths of\nyears, namely, forty-nine years. 9You shall
    then sound a ram\u2019s horn abroad\non the tenth day of the seventh month; on
    the day of atonement you shall\nsound a horn all through your land. 10You shall
    thus consecrate the\nfiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to
    all its\ninhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, and each of you shall return
    to\nhis own property, and each of you shall return to his family. 11You shall\nhave
    the fiftieth year as a jubilee; you shall not sow, nor reap its\naftergrowth,
    nor gather in from its untrimmed vines. 12For it is a jubilee;\nit shall be holy
    to you. You shall eat its crops out of the field.</p>\n<p>13\u2018On this year
    of jubilee each of you shall return to his own property.\n14If you make a sale,
    moreover, to your friend or buy from your friend\u2019s\nhand, you shall not wrong
    one another. 15Corresponding to the number of\nyears after the jubilee, you shall
    buy from your friend; he is to sell to\nyou according to the number of years of
    crops. 16In proportion to the\nextent of the years you shall increase its price,
    and in proportion to the\nfewness of the years you shall diminish its price, for
    it is a number of\ncrops he is selling to you. 17So you shall not wrong one another,
    but you\nshall fear your God; for I am the Lord your God.</p>\n<p>18\u2018You
    shall thus observe My statutes and keep My judgments, so as to carry\nthem out,
    that you may live securely on the land. 19Then the land will\nyield its produce,
    so that you can eat your fill and live securely on it.\n20But if you say, \u201CWhat
    are we going to eat on the seventh year if we do\nnot sow or gather in our crops?\u201D
    21then I will so order My blessing for you\nin the sixth year that it will bring
    forth the crop for three years. 22When\nyou are sowing the eighth year, you can
    still eat old things from the crop,\neating the old until the ninth year when
    its crop comes in.</p>\n<p>The Law of Redemption</p>\n<p>23\u2018The land, moreover,
    shall not be sold permanently, for the land is Mine;\nfor you are but aliens and
    sojourners with Me. 24Thus for every piece of\nyour property, you are to provide
    for the redemption of the land.</p>\n<p>25\u2018If a fellow countryman of yours
    becomes so poor he has to sell part of\nhis property, then his nearest kinsman
    is to come and buy back what his\nrelative has sold. 26Or in case a man has no
    kinsman, but so recovers his\nmeans as to find sufficient for its redemption,
    27then he shall calculate\nthe years since its sale and refund the balance to
    the man to whom he sold\nit, and so return to his property. 28But if he has not
    found sufficient\nmeans to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall
    remain in the\nhands of its purchaser until the year of jubilee; but at the jubilee
    it\nshall revert, that he may return to his property.</p>\n<p>29\u2018Likewise,
    if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then his\nredemption right remains
    valid until a full year from its sale; his right\nof redemption lasts a full year.
    30But if it is not bought back for him\nwithin the space of a full year, then
    the house that is in the walled city\npasses permanently to its purchaser throughout
    his generations; it does not\nrevert in the jubilee. 31The houses of the villages,
    however, which have no\nsurrounding wall shall be considered as open fields; they
    have redemption\nrights and revert in the jubilee. 32As for cities of the Levites,
    the\nLevites have a permanent right of redemption for the houses of the cities\nwhich
    are their possession. 33What, therefore, belongs to the Levites may\nbe redeemed
    and a house sale in the city of this possession reverts in the\njubilee, for the
    houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession\namong the sons of Israel.
    34But pasture fields of their cities shall not be\nsold, for that is their perpetual
    possession.</p>\n<p>Of Poor Countrymen</p>\n<p>35\u2018Now in case a countryman
    of yours becomes poor and his means with regard\nto you falter, then you are to
    sustain him, like a stranger or a sojourner,\nthat he may live with you. 36Do
    not take usurious interest from him, but\nrevere your God, that your countryman
    may live with you. 37You shall not\ngive him your silver at interest, nor your
    food for gain. 38I am the Lord\nyour God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt
    to give you the land of\nCanaan and to be your God.</p>\n<p>39\u2018If a countryman
    of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he\nsells himself to you, you
    shall not subject him to a slave\u2019s service. 40He\nshall be with you as a
    hired man, as if he were a sojourner; he shall serve\nwith you until the year
    of jubilee. 41He shall then go out from you, he and\nhis sons with him, and shall
    go back to his family, that he may return to\nthe property of his forefathers.
    42For they are My servants whom I brought\nout from the land of Egypt; they are
    not to be sold in a slave sale. 43You\nshall not rule over him with severity,
    but are to revere your God. 44As for\nyour male and female slaves whom you may
    have\u2014you may acquire male and\nfemale slaves from the pagan nations that
    are around you. 45Then, too, it\nis out of the sons of the sojourners who live
    as aliens among you that you\nmay gain acquisition, and out of their families
    who are with you, whom they\nwill have produced in your land; they also may become
    your possession.\n46You may even bequeath them to your sons after you, to receive
    as a\npossession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to your\ncountrymen,
    the sons of Israel, you shall not rule with severity over one\nanother.</p>\n<p>Of
    Redeeming a Poor Man</p>\n<p>47\u2018Now if the means of a stranger or of a sojourner
    with you becomes\nsufficient, and a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard
    to him as\nto sell himself to a stranger who is sojourning with you, or to the\ndescendants
    of a stranger\u2019s family, 48then he shall have redemption right\nafter he has
    been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him, 49or his uncle,\nor his uncle\u2019s
    son, may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives from his\nfamily may redeem
    him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself. 50He then\nwith his purchaser shall
    calculate from the year when he sold himself to\nhim up to the year of jubilee;
    and the price of his sale shall correspond\nto the number of years. It is like
    the days of a hired man that he shall be\nwith him. 51If there are still many
    years, he shall refund part of his\npurchase price in proportion to them for his
    own redemption; 52and if few\nyears remain until the year of jubilee, he shall
    so calculate with him. In\nproportion to his years he is to refund the amount
    for his redemption.\n53Like a man hired year by year he shall be with him; he
    shall not rule\nover him with severity in your sight. 54Even if he is not redeemed
    by these\nmeans, he shall still go out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons
    with\nhim. 55For the sons of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom
    I\nbrought out from the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.</p>\n</div>\n<div

    the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord\nGod had
    made. And he said to the woman, \u201CIndeed, has God said, \u2018You shall\nnot
    eat from any tree of the garden\u2019?\u201D 2The woman said to the serpent,\n\u201CFrom
    the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; 3but from the fruit\nof the tree
    which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, \u2018You shall\nnot eat from
    it or touch it, or you will die.\u2019\u2009\u201D 4The serpent said to the\nwoman,
    \u201CYou surely will not die! 5For God knows that in the day you eat\nfrom it
    your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good\nand evil.\u201D
    6When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it\nwas a delight
    to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one\nwise, she took from
    its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband\nwith her, and he ate. 7Then
    the eyes of both of them were opened, and they\nknew that they were naked; and
    they sewed fig leaves together and made\nthemselves loin coverings.</p>\n<p>21The
    Lord God made garments of skin for Adam\nand his wife, and clothed them. 22Then
    the Lord God said, \u201CBehold, the man\nhas become like one of Us, knowing good
    and evil; and now, he might stretch\nout his hand, and take also from the tree
    of life, and eat, and live\nforever\u201D\u2014 23therefore the Lord God sent
    him out from the garden of Eden, to\ncultivate the ground from which he was taken.
    24So He drove the man out;\nand at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed
    the cherubim and the\nflaming sword which turned every direction to guard the

    They are templted to believe that they\nwould be right to knowing good and evil
    (ironic since they know it's bad to eat\nof the Tree of Knowledge anyways)</p>\n<p>They
    acted by listening to the serpent, and to themselves... essentially they\nchose
    to not listen and adhere to Yahweh. This choice represents stark and\nobvious
    rebellion. Yahweh, I think, sees that his creation are tempted to go\ntheir own
    way, and for their own protection exiles them from the Garden.</p>\n<p>It seems
    like lies haven't changed; ultimately we are still tempted to define\ngood and
    evil/bad for ourselves. I take action by defining wicked things as\ngood - made
    obvious by the fact that I choose to sin often, choose to not\nlisten to Yahweh.
    Actively listening to myself is exhausting. I think there's a\nlot to discussing

    for the redemption of the land.</p>\n<p>25\u2018If a fellow countryman of yours
    becomes so poor he has to sell part of\nhis property, then his nearest kinsman
    is to come and buy back what his\nrelative has sold. 26Or in case a man has no
    kinsman, but so recovers his\nmeans as to find sufficient for its redemption,
    27then he shall calculate\nthe years since its sale and refund the balance to
    the man to whom he sold\nit, and so return to his property. 28But if he has not
    found sufficient\nmeans to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall
    remain in the\nhands of its purchaser until the year of jubilee; but at the jubilee
    it\nshall revert, that he may return to his property.</p>\n<p>29\u2018Likewise,
    if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then his\nredemption right remains
    valid until a full year from its sale; his right\nof redemption lasts a full year.
    30But if it is not bought back for him\nwithin the space of a full year, then
    the house that is in the walled city\npasses permanently to its purchaser throughout
    his generations; it does not\nrevert in the jubilee. 31The houses of the villages,
    however, which have no\nsurrounding wall shall be considered as open fields; they
    have redemption\nrights and revert in the jubilee. 32As for cities of the Levites,
    the\nLevites have a permanent right of redemption for the houses of the cities\nwhich
    are their possession. 33What, therefore, belongs to the Levites may\nbe redeemed
    and a house sale in the city of this possession reverts in the\njubilee, for the
    houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession\namong the sons of Israel.
    34But pasture fields of their cities shall not be\nsold, for that is their perpetual
    possession.</p>\n<p>Of Poor Countrymen</p>\n<p>35\u2018Now in case a countryman
    of yours becomes poor and his means with regard\nto you falter, then you are to
    sustain him, like a stranger or a sojourner,\nthat he may live with you. 36Do
    not take usurious interest from him, but\nrevere your God, that your countryman
    may live with you. 37You shall not\ngive him your silver at interest, nor your
    food for gain. 38I am the Lord\nyour God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt
    to give you the land of\nCanaan and to be your God.</p>\n<p>39\u2018If a countryman
    of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he\nsells himself to you, you
    shall not subject him to a slave\u2019s service. 40He\nshall be with you as a
    hired man, as if he were a sojourner; he shall serve\nwith you until the year
    of jubilee. 41He shall then go out from you, he and\nhis sons with him, and shall
    go back to his family, that he may return to\nthe property of his forefathers.
    42For they are My servants whom I brought\nout from the land of Egypt; they are
    not to be sold in a slave sale. 43You\nshall not rule over him with severity,
    but are to revere your God. 44As for\nyour male and female slaves whom you may
    have\u2014you may acquire male and\nfemale slaves from the pagan nations that
    are around you. 45Then, too, it\nis out of the sons of the sojourners who live
    as aliens among you that you\nmay gain acquisition, and out of their families
    who are with you, whom they\nwill have produced in your land; they also may become
    your possession.\n46You may even bequeath them to your sons after you, to receive
    as a\npossession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to your\ncountrymen,
    the sons of Israel, you shall not rule with severity over one\nanother.</p>\n<p>Of
    Redeeming a Poor Man</p>\n<p>47\u2018Now if the means of a stranger or of a sojourner
    with you becomes\nsufficient, and a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard
    to him as\nto sell himself to a stranger who is sojourning with you, or to the\ndescendants
    of a stranger\u2019s family, 48then he shall have redemption right\nafter he has
    been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him, 49or his uncle,\nor his uncle\u2019s
    son, may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives from his\nfamily may redeem
    him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself. 50He then\nwith his purchaser shall
    calculate from the year when he sold himself to\nhim up to the year of jubilee;
    and the price of his sale shall correspond\nto the number of years. It is like
    the days of a hired man that he shall be\nwith him. 51If there are still many
    years, he shall refund part of his\npurchase price in proportion to them for his
    own redemption; 52and if few\nyears remain until the year of jubilee, he shall
    so calculate with him. In\nproportion to his years he is to refund the amount
    for his redemption.\n53Like a man hired year by year he shall be with him; he
    shall not rule\nover him with severity in your sight. 54Even if he is not redeemed
    by these\nmeans, he shall still go out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons
    with\nhim. 55For the sons of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom
    I\nbrought out from the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.</p>\n</div>\n<div

    Creation\n\nBrougt to completion on the seventh day in Genesis 1. It is the only
    day that\ndoes not end with 'there evening and there was morning, the Nth day'\n\nHumans
    were meant to rest with God in his creation forever, but in their\nrebllion they
    are sentenced to work as slaves to the land. The rest of the\nhsitory of God's
    people consists of them looking for God's rest, but\nconsistently falling back
    into slavery/(fallen) work.\n\n## Sabbath\n\nCelebated every week on the 7th day.
    The idea is to live in the eternal rest that God offered in creation.\n\n## Jubilee\n\nEvery
    7 * 7 years is the Ultimate Sabbath - the land is reset (or was supposed\nto be),
    everything was returned to the original owner, debt does not persist -\neverything
    resets so everyone can rest.\n\n# Jesus\n\nJesus calls himself the Lord of the
    Sabbath. He claimed to bring the ultimate\nrest of God. Jesus was crucified at
    a specific time - on Good Friday, and he\nrose again on the following Sunday...
    which is the first day of the next week\n_or_ the 8th day... the first day of
    a new age, a new rest, God's ultimate\nsabbath that is symbolized in the 7th day
    of creation.\n\n# Questions\n\n!!! note \"1\"\n\n    How does the author of Genesis
    conclude each of the seven days of creation?\n    Consider the seventh day of
    creation as an ultimate rest day. What do you\n    think it would be like to always
    live in that rest with God?\n\n!!! Scripture \"Genesis 1:5,8,13,19,23,31; 2:1-3
    5\"\n\n    5God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there
    was\n    evening and there was morning, one day.\n\n    8God called the expanse
    heaven. And there was evening and there was\n    morning, a second day.\n\n    13There
    was evening and there was morning, a third day.\n\n    19There was evening and
    there was morning, a fourth day.\n\n    23There was evening and there was morning,
    a fifth day.\n\n    31God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good.
    And there was\n    evening and there was morning, the sixth day.\n\n    The Creation
    of Man and Woman\n\n    1Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all
    their hosts. 2By\n    the seventh day God completed His work which He had done,
    and He rested on\n    the seventh day from all His work which He had done. 3Then
    God blessed the\n    seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from
    all His work\n    which God had created and made.\n\nI imagine it would've looked
    a lot like enjoying the creation... I work at\nthings I love, and that can be
    restful to me - I find purpose and order in my\nhobbies and so I bet life would
    be like that. The work woudl be productive but\nnot toilsome.\n\n\n!!! note \"2\"\n\n
    \   Read Genesis 3:1-7 and 3:21-24 What were the humans tempted to believe\n    about
    God and themselves? How did they act on these beliefs, and how did\n    this choice
    exile them from the place of rest? How do you think lies about\n    God and ourselves
    prevent us from resting with God today?\n\n!!! scripture \"Genesis 3:1-7,21-24\"\n\n
    \   The Fall of Man\n\n    1Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of

    surely will not die! 5For God knows that in the day you eat\n    from it your
    eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good\n    and evil.\u201D
    6When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it\n    was a delight
    to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one\n    wise, she took from
    its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband\n    with her, and he ate.

    from which he was taken. 24So He drove the man out;\n    and at the east of the
    garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the\n    flaming sword which turned

    you shall not reap, and your grapes\n    of untrimmed vines you shall not gather;
    the land shall have a sabbatical\n    year. 6All of you shall have the sabbath

    and your hired man and your\n    foreign resident, those who live as aliens with
    you. 7Even your cattle and\n    the animals that are in your land shall have all

    and each of you shall return to his family. 11You shall\n    have the fiftieth
    year as a jubilee; you shall not sow, nor reap its\n    aftergrowth, nor gather
    in from its untrimmed vines. 12For it is a jubilee;\n    it shall be holy to you.
    You shall eat its crops out of the field.\n\n    13\u2018On this year of jubilee
    each of you shall return to his own property.\n    14If you make a sale, moreover,
    to your friend or buy from your friend\u2019s\n    hand, you shall not wrong one
    another. 15Corresponding to the number of\n    years after the jubilee, you shall
    buy from your friend; he is to sell to\n    you according to the number of years
    of crops. 16In proportion to the\n    extent of the years you shall increase its
    price, and in proportion to the\n    fewness of the years you shall diminish its
    price, for it is a number of\n    crops he is selling to you. 17So you shall not
    wrong one another, but you\n    shall fear your God; for I am the Lord your God.\n\n
    \   18\u2018You shall thus observe My statutes and keep My judgments, so as to
    carry\n    them out, that you may live securely on the land. 19Then the land will\n
    \   yield its produce, so that you can eat your fill and live securely on it.\n
    \   20But if you say, \u201CWhat are we going to eat on the seventh year if we
    do\n    not sow or gather in our crops?\u201D 21then I will so order My blessing
    for you\n    in the sixth year that it will bring forth the crop for three years.
    22When\n    you are sowing the eighth year, you can still eat old things from
    the crop,\n    eating the old until the ninth year when its crop comes in.\n\n
    \   The Law of Redemption\n\n    23\u2018The land, moreover, shall not be sold
    permanently, for the land is Mine;\n    for you are but aliens and sojourners
    with Me. 24Thus for every piece of\n    your property, you are to provide for
    the redemption of the land.\n\n    25\u2018If a fellow countryman of yours becomes
    so poor he has to sell part of\n    his property, then his nearest kinsman is
    to come and buy back what his\n    relative has sold. 26Or in case a man has no
    kinsman, but so recovers his\n    means as to find sufficient for its redemption,
    27then he shall calculate\n    the years since its sale and refund the balance
    to the man to whom he sold\n    it, and so return to his property. 28But if he
    has not found sufficient\n    means to get it back for himself, then what he has
    sold shall remain in the\n    hands of its purchaser until the year of jubilee;
    but at the jubilee it\n    shall revert, that he may return to his property.\n\n
    \   29\u2018Likewise, if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then his\n
    \   redemption right remains valid until a full year from its sale; his right\n
    \   of redemption lasts a full year. 30But if it is not bought back for him\n
    \   within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city\n
    \   passes permanently to its purchaser throughout his generations; it does not\n
    \   revert in the jubilee. 31The houses of the villages, however, which have no\n
    \   surrounding wall shall be considered as open fields; they have redemption\n
    \   rights and revert in the jubilee. 32As for cities of the Levites, the\n    Levites
    have a permanent right of redemption for the houses of the cities\n    which are
    their possession. 33What, therefore, belongs to the Levites may\n    be redeemed
    and a house sale in the city of this possession reverts in the\n    jubilee, for
    the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession\n    among the sons
    of Israel. 34But pasture fields of their cities shall not be\n    sold, for that
    is their perpetual possession.\n\n    Of Poor Countrymen\n\n    35\u2018Now in
    case a countryman of yours becomes poor and his means with regard\n    to you
    falter, then you are to sustain him, like a stranger or a sojourner,\n    that
    he may live with you. 36Do not take usurious interest from him, but\n    revere
    your God, that your countryman may live with you. 37You shall not\n    give him
    your silver at interest, nor your food for gain. 38I am the Lord\n    your God,
    who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of\n    Canaan and
    to be your God.\n\n    39\u2018If a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard
    to you that he\n    sells himself to you, you shall not subject him to a slave\u2019s
    service. 40He\n    shall be with you as a hired man, as if he were a sojourner;
    he shall serve\n    with you until the year of jubilee. 41He shall then go out
    from you, he and\n    his sons with him, and shall go back to his family, that
    he may return to\n    the property of his forefathers. 42For they are My servants
    whom I brought\n    out from the land of Egypt; they are not to be sold in a slave
    sale. 43You\n    shall not rule over him with severity, but are to revere your
    God. 44As for\n    your male and female slaves whom you may have\u2014you may
    acquire male and\n    female slaves from the pagan nations that are around you.
    45Then, too, it\n    is out of the sons of the sojourners who live as aliens among
    you that you\n    may gain acquisition, and out of their families who are with
    you, whom they\n    will have produced in your land; they also may become your
    possession.\n    46You may even bequeath them to your sons after you, to receive
    as a\n    possession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to
    your\n    countrymen, the sons of Israel, you shall not rule with severity over
    one\n    another.\n\n    Of Redeeming a Poor Man\n\n    47\u2018Now if the means
    of a stranger or of a sojourner with you becomes\n    sufficient, and a countryman
    of yours becomes so poor with regard to him as\n    to sell himself to a stranger
    who is sojourning with you, or to the\n    descendants of a stranger\u2019s family,
    48then he shall have redemption right\n    after he has been sold. One of his
    brothers may redeem him, 49or his uncle,\n    or his uncle\u2019s son, may redeem
    him, or one of his blood relatives from his\n    family may redeem him; or if
    he prospers, he may redeem himself. 50He then\n    with his purchaser shall calculate
    from the year when he sold himself to\n    him up to the year of jubilee; and
    the price of his sale shall correspond\n    to the number of years. It is like
    the days of a hired man that he shall be\n    with him. 51If there are still many
    years, he shall refund part of his\n    purchase price in proportion to them for
    his own redemption; 52and if few\n    years remain until the year of jubilee,
    he shall so calculate with him. In\n    proportion to his years he is to refund
    the amount for his redemption.\n    53Like a man hired year by year he shall be
    with him; he shall not rule\n    over him with severity in your sight. 54Even
    if he is not redeemed by these\n    means, he shall still go out in the year of
    jubilee, he and his sons with\n    him. 55For the sons of Israel are My servants;
    they are My servants whom I\n    brought out from the land of Egypt. I am the
    Lord your God.\n\n\n!!! note \"5\"\n\n    What is one specific way Jesus invites

# Creation

Brougt to completion on the seventh day in Genesis 1. It is the only day that
does not end with 'there evening and there was morning, the Nth day'

Humans were meant to rest with God in his creation forever, but in their
rebllion they are sentenced to work as slaves to the land. The rest of the
hsitory of God's people consists of them looking for God's rest, but
consistently falling back into slavery/(fallen) work.

## Sabbath

Celebated every week on the 7th day. The idea is to live in the eternal rest that God offered in creation.

## Jubilee

Every 7 * 7 years is the Ultimate Sabbath - the land is reset (or was supposed
to be), everything was returned to the original owner, debt does not persist -
everything resets so everyone can rest.

# Jesus

Jesus calls himself the Lord of the Sabbath. He claimed to bring the ultimate
rest of God. Jesus was crucified at a specific time - on Good Friday, and he
rose again on the following Sunday... which is the first day of the next week
_or_ the 8th day... the first day of a new age, a new rest, God's ultimate
sabbath that is symbolized in the 7th day of creation.

# Questions

!!! note "1"

    How does the author of Genesis conclude each of the seven days of creation?
    Consider the seventh day of creation as an ultimate rest day. What do you
    think it would be like to always live in that rest with God?

!!! Scripture "Genesis 1:5,8,13,19,23,31; 2:1-3 5"

    5God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there was
    evening and there was morning, one day.

    8God called the expanse heaven. And there was evening and there was
    morning, a second day.

    13There was evening and there was morning, a third day.

    19There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.

    23There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.

    31God saw all that He had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was
    evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

    The Creation of Man and Woman

    1Thus the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. 2By
    the seventh day God completed His work which He had done, and He rested on
    the seventh day from all His work which He had done. 3Then God blessed the
    seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work
    which God had created and made.

I imagine it would've looked a lot like enjoying the creation... I work at
things I love, and that can be restful to me - I find purpose and order in my
hobbies and so I bet life would be like that. The work woudl be productive but
not toilsome.


!!! note "2"

    Read Genesis 3:1-7 and 3:21-24 What were the humans tempted to believe
    about God and themselves? How did they act on these beliefs, and how did
    this choice exile them from the place of rest? How do you think lies about
    God and ourselves prevent us from resting with God today?

!!! scripture "Genesis 3:1-7,21-24"

    The Fall of Man

    1Now the serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field which the Lord
    God had made. And he said to the woman, “Indeed, has God said, ‘You shall
    not eat from any tree of the garden’?” 2The woman said to the serpent,
    “From the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat; 3but from the fruit
    of the tree which is in the middle of the garden, God has said, ‘You shall
    not eat from it or touch it, or you will die.’ ” 4The serpent said to the
    woman, “You surely will not die! 5For God knows that in the day you eat
    from it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good
    and evil.” 6When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it
    was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable to make one
    wise, she took from its fruit and ate; and she gave also to her husband
    with her, and he ate. 7Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they
    knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made
    themselves loin coverings. 

    21The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam
    and his wife, and clothed them. 22Then the Lord God said, “Behold, the man
    has become like one of Us, knowing good and evil; and now, he might stretch
    out his hand, and take also from the tree of life, and eat, and live
    forever”— 23therefore the Lord God sent him out from the garden of Eden, to
    cultivate the ground from which he was taken. 24So He drove the man out;
    and at the east of the garden of Eden He stationed the cherubim and the
    flaming sword which turned every direction to guard the way to the tree of
    life.

Humans are templted to believe that God is witholding desirableble information
they are templted to _be like God_. They are templted to believe that they
would be right to knowing good and evil (ironic since they know it's bad to eat
of the Tree of Knowledge anyways)

They acted by listening to the serpent, and to themselves... essentially they
chose to not listen and adhere to Yahweh. This choice represents stark and
obvious rebellion. Yahweh, I think, sees that his creation are tempted to go
their own way, and for their own protection exiles them from the Garden.

It seems like lies haven't changed; ultimately we are still tempted to define
good and evil/bad for ourselves. I take action by defining wicked things as
good - made obvious by the fact that I choose to sin often, choose to not
listen to Yahweh. Actively listening to myself is exhausting. I think there's a
lot to discussing "God's rest", but a high and almost trivial level, I am
simply less tired when my life is more in step with God's definitions of good
and bad

!!! note "3"

    God wants to restore humanity to ultimate rest, so he chooses the
    Israelites to reenact his seventh-day rest so they can share it with
    others. Of all the ways he invites them to practice rest which practice are
    you least familiar with today?

!!! scripture "Exodus 20:8-11"

    8“Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9Six days you shall labor and
    do all your work, 10but the seventh day is a sabbath of the Lord your God;
    in it you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your
    male or your female servant or your cattle or your sojourner who stays with
    you. 11For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea and
    all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the Lord
    blessed the sabbath day and made it holy.

!!! scripture "Leviticus 23:1-3; 25:8-13"

    Laws of Religious Festivals

    1The Lord spoke again to Moses, saying, 2“Speak to the sons of Israel and
    say to them, ‘The Lord’s appointed times which you shall proclaim as holy
    convocations—My appointed times are these:

    3‘For six days work may be done, but on the seventh day there is a sabbath
    of complete rest, a holy convocation. You shall not do any work; it is a
    sabbath to the Lord in all your dwellings.

    8‘You are also to count off seven sabbaths of years for yourself, seven
    times seven years, so that you have the time of the seven sabbaths of
    years, namely, forty-nine years. 9You shall then sound a ram’s horn abroad
    on the tenth day of the seventh month; on the day of atonement you shall
    sound a horn all through your land. 10You shall thus consecrate the
    fiftieth year and proclaim a release through the land to all its
    inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, and each of you shall return to
    his own property, and each of you shall return to his family. 11You shall
    have the fiftieth year as a jubilee; you shall not sow, nor reap its
    aftergrowth, nor gather in from its untrimmed vines. 12For it is a jubilee;
    it shall be holy to you. You shall eat its crops out of the field.

    13‘On this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his own property.


!!! note "4"

    Jesus comes to restore us to God’s eternal rest! How does Jesus launch his
    public ministry? Read Luke 4:14-21, noting that the year of favor refers to
    the ultimate Jubilee—Israel’s super-charged Sabbath 

    What do you observe?

!!! scripture "Luke 4:14-21"

    Jesus’ Public Ministry

    14And Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and news about
    Him spread through all the surrounding district. 15And He began teaching in
    their synagogues and was praised by all.

    16And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up; and as was His
    custom, He entered the synagogue on the Sabbath, and stood up to read.
    17And the book of the prophet Isaiah was handed to Him. And He opened the
    book and found the place where it was written,

    18“The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me,

    Because He anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor.

    He has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives,

    And recovery of sight to the blind,

    To set free those who are oppressed,

    19To proclaim the favorable year of the Lord.”

    20And He closed the book, gave it back to the attendant and sat down; and
    the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on Him. 21And He began to say
    to them, “Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”

!!! scripture "Leviticus 25"

    The Sabbatic Year and Year of Jubilee

    1The Lord then spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, saying, 2“Speak to the sons
    of Israel and say to them, ‘When you come into the land which I shall give
    you, then the land shall have a sabbath to the Lord. 3Six years you shall
    sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in
    its crop, 4but during the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath rest,
    a sabbath to the Lord; you shall not sow your field nor prune your
    vineyard. 5Your harvest’s aftergrowth you shall not reap, and your grapes
    of untrimmed vines you shall not gather; the land shall have a sabbatical
    year. 6All of you shall have the sabbath products of the land for food;
    yourself, and your male and female slaves, and your hired man and your
    foreign resident, those who live as aliens with you. 7Even your cattle and

    years after the jubilee, you shall buy from your friend; he is to sell to
    you according to the number of years of crops. 16In proportion to the
    extent of the years you shall increase its price, and in proportion to the
    fewness of the years you shall diminish its price, for it is a number of
    crops he is selling to you. 17So you shall not wrong one another, but you
    shall fear your God; for I am the Lord your God.

    18‘You shall thus observe My statutes and keep My judgments, so as to carry
    them out, that you may live securely on the land. 19Then the land will
    yield its produce, so that you can eat your fill and live securely on it.
    20But if you say, “What are we going to eat on the seventh year if we do
    not sow or gather in our crops?” 21then I will so order My blessing for you
    in the sixth year that it will bring forth the crop for three years. 22When
    you are sowing the eighth year, you can still eat old things from the crop,
    eating the old until the ninth year when its crop comes in.

    The Law of Redemption

    23‘The land, moreover, shall not be sold permanently, for the land is Mine;
    for you are but aliens and sojourners with Me. 24Thus for every piece of
    your property, you are to provide for the redemption of the land.

    25‘If a fellow countryman of yours becomes so poor he has to sell part of
    his property, then his nearest kinsman is to come and buy back what his
    relative has sold. 26Or in case a man has no kinsman, but so recovers his
    means as to find sufficient for its redemption, 27then he shall calculate
    the years since its sale and refund the balance to the man to whom he sold
    it, and so return to his property. 28But if he has not found sufficient
    means to get it back for himself, then what he has sold shall remain in the
    hands of its purchaser until the year of jubilee; but at the jubilee it
    shall revert, that he may return to his property.

    29‘Likewise, if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then his
    redemption right remains valid until a full year from its sale; his right
    of redemption lasts a full year. 30But if it is not bought back for him
    within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city
    passes permanently to its purchaser throughout his generations; it does not
    revert in the jubilee. 31The houses of the villages, however, which have no
    surrounding wall shall be considered as open fields; they have redemption
    rights and revert in the jubilee. 32As for cities of the Levites, the
    Levites have a permanent right of redemption for the houses of the cities
    which are their possession. 33What, therefore, belongs to the Levites may
    be redeemed and a house sale in the city of this possession reverts in the
    jubilee, for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession
    among the sons of Israel. 34But pasture fields of their cities shall not be
    sold, for that is their perpetual possession.

    Of Poor Countrymen

    35‘Now in case a countryman of yours becomes poor and his means with regard
    to you falter, then you are to sustain him, like a stranger or a sojourner,
    that he may live with you. 36Do not take usurious interest from him, but
    revere your God, that your countryman may live with you. 37You shall not
    give him your silver at interest, nor your food for gain. 38I am the Lord
    your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of
    Canaan and to be your God.

    39‘If a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he
    sells himself to you, you shall not subject him to a slave’s service. 40He
    shall be with you as a hired man, as if he were a sojourner; he shall serve
    with you until the year of jubilee. 41He shall then go out from you, he and
    his sons with him, and shall go back to his family, that he may return to
    the property of his forefathers. 42For they are My servants whom I brought
    out from the land of Egypt; they are not to be sold in a slave sale. 43You
    shall not rule over him with severity, but are to revere your God. 44As for
    your male and female slaves whom you may have—you may acquire male and
    female slaves from the pagan nations that are around you. 45Then, too, it
    is out of the sons of the sojourners who live as aliens among you that you
    may gain acquisition, and out of their families who are with you, whom they
    will have produced in your land; they also may become your possession.
    46You may even bequeath them to your sons after you, to receive as a
    possession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to your
    countrymen, the sons of Israel, you shall not rule with severity over one
    another.

    Of Redeeming a Poor Man

    47‘Now if the means of a stranger or of a sojourner with you becomes
    sufficient, and a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to him as
    to sell himself to a stranger who is sojourning with you, or to the
    descendants of a stranger’s family, 48then he shall have redemption right
    after he has been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him, 49or his uncle,
    or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives from his
    family may redeem him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself. 50He then
    with his purchaser shall calculate from the year when he sold himself to
    him up to the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall correspond
    to the number of years. It is like the days of a hired man that he shall be
    with him. 51If there are still many years, he shall refund part of his
    purchase price in proportion to them for his own redemption; 52and if few
    years remain until the year of jubilee, he shall so calculate with him. In
    proportion to his years he is to refund the amount for his redemption.
    53Like a man hired year by year he shall be with him; he shall not rule
    over him with severity in your sight. 54Even if he is not redeemed by these
    means, he shall still go out in the year of jubilee, he and his sons with
    him. 55For the sons of Israel are My servants; they are My servants whom I
    brought out from the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God.
