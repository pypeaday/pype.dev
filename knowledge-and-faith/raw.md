# A Question

What does it mean to be "faithful"? I wrestle with this question in various
contexts pretty regularly - mostly because God has been so ridiculously stupid
good to me that I feel compelled to ask daily "am I being faithful with the
gifts God has given me?"

There's a lot of places to go from this starting point, but there's some events
happening in my life that are giving me perspective on Jesus' faithfulness to
the Father's will and what it implies for my own life of faithfulness and
steadfastness to the Lord.

## Faithfulness

How do I be more like Jesus (as a human), and how do I more or less copy his
faithfulness to God in the wake of trial. I've certainly given some amount of
thought to my own ability to be faithful in the worst potential circumstance of
straight up physical execution: martyrdom... In Fox's Book of Martyrs there's
accounts of Christians through the ages singing hymns while being
burned alive for their faith... What leads to that kind of faithfulness? What
gave these heros of the faith the peace to face death with a song? Would
I, today right now, if I was going to be executed for my faith (real reality in
many parts of the world) would I sing "Amazing Grace" while my physical body
was tortured to death... I can't say I know the answer to this, but the
accounts of these martyrs is at least encouraging that God has developed the
faith of others to such a degree that physical torture cannot break them from
their communion with God.

!!! note "What about NOT death..."
    
    We all face trials of different kinds every day, and in the face of those trials what does faithfulness look like?

## Knowledge

Back to Jesus for a second... A confession of mine is that I've lowkey felt
like Jesus, as truly human, had a leg up on us when it comes to remaining
faithful to the Father's will.... 

As a human he walked through life in deep communion
with the Father, and he _knows_ his place as the Author of creation, the one
who holds all things together. So I've often struggled with the thought "of
course Jesus is calm in X or isn't worried about Y... He knows he's God, he
knows the plan, and that _knowledge_ must do something for enabling the kind
of calm faith we see in the person, in the human, Jesus Christ."

!!! waring ""

    Jesus _knows_ that if he commanded a mountain to cast itself into the sea, that it would... So did Jesus have _faith_ or _knowledge_?

## Almost There

I think he had both, and part of living a life of faith is _remembering_ all the
things that are true about Jesus... If I only say he's faithful and good to me
because the Bible says so, well that's not a lot for me as a real physical
person to live my life on... I live my life based on experience like anyone
else, and experience gives anyone a unique kind of knowledge - it's more than
reading something in a book, when you learn something by living through it the
message is deeply engrained, it passes through your brain and into your
being... ya know what I'm saying? There's things we know and then there's
things _we KNOW_. 

But for this to happen we have to acknowledge God through it
all... whatever "it all" is certainly affects what "acknowledge God" means, but
for Jesus he certainly gave God the Father every ounce of glory and credit
during his life, and that acknowledgement I believe is a part of Jesus' life of
Faith... so too in my life do I try to practice this perspective - giving
thanks to God for all things given and taken away... This acknowledgement
presses the truth about God's goodness and faithfulness to me deeper and deeper
into my being. It is Jesus being tender to my heart and shepherding me into
being more like him

Jesus _knew_ everything true about his power because of his experience and
identity. I would certainly claim to know it as well - but _my_ knowledge of
Jesus' power is not _his_ knowledge of his own power. So does any knowledge I
have or lack affect the reality of Jesus' faithfulness?

!!! danger "no..."

## The Point

This is finally my point... I'm going through a trial, losing something
important to me that's valuable and a source of provision for my family in many
ways. But at the same time... God has been so good to me, and I have so much
experience and knowledge of that goodness... I've been complimented by a few
people in this situation about how I'm handling it - cause anyone would be
pretty justified in being angry in what I'm walking through... And I'm
struggling with many emotions:

!!! note "but ultimately"

    I know God provides for me

and losing a massive source of that provision isn't the end of the world because
not only do I know that God provides for me, but he already has provided in
such a way that this trial isn't devastating. It's annoying of course, but his
goodness to me so outshines the crappiness of this situation that I can't help
but overflow with "this sucks but God's stil good, and has been and will be". 

The thing is that the people around me do not have all the same _knowledge_ as
me that I've gained through _experience_ and acknowledgment of God's
goodness... Few people see all the details of how God has and is protecting me
and my family that to the outsider of my life, witnessing what's happening, I
might look like that martyr being burned alive.... Of course that's a little
hyperbolic, but I don't know the lives of all those martyrs - God probably
worked in them for so long and in such deep ways that not only the reality of a
trial, but the reality of physical pain, just washes over them... 

!!! note "That's how I feel"

    my trial here sucks, I even want to complain about it (and will probably) but ultimately God is so good to me, and I'll make that known to everyone around me. 

It might look miraculous to them, and it doesn't mean it's
not, because it's God who provided for me in the first place, but my place of
serenity in the wake of trial comes from Jesus pressing the reality of his
faithfulness into my life, and now that I have a backdrop of years of goodness
from him - how can any one silly trial in this life send me anywhere but closer
to my Heavenly Father as I trust him for provision.
