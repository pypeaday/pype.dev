Here's my thought on <a href="https://docs.atuin.sh/self-hosting/docker/#using-systemd-to-manage-your-atuin-server">💭 Docker | Atuin Docs</a>

A 2-fer... So I want to host atuin and share shell history across my machines on my tailnet I think... it's such a nice interface but I barely use it so I'm sure the features will improve some aspects of my life. And secondly, this section on using systemd is interesting... I hadn't thought to use systemd to schedule container upgrades - sounds incredibly trivial and probably a widely practiced thing now that I say it out loud... Saving here for implementing something... sometime...
