<p>Ok this is crazy but 2 nights ago I saw a UFO, or like 5 of them, and I wrote something about them and am now just gonna put some thoughts here... publicity be damned</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>4-pointed star, inner-curved, lights moving through the sky</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The light was a shimmering green/aquamarine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I saw 2 small and 1 big lights where the big one split up and that turned into 5 total objects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thought it might've been the Northern Lights, but that would've been the whole sky or something larger, and visible for longer... this was like a plane flying across the horizon, except it was night and 5 UFOs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flight pattern of the lights was like fighter jets, that's how I would describe the movement and like flight characteristics that I would just expect to see if some F15s flew by or something.
It was faster than a commercial plane but not faster than I could imagine a jet flying by, and like coordinated movement between all of them</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Possibilities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Drone: real possibility and I already don't know what of my memory that I can trust but... I think I would've recognized something like a drone at the time, I can't really convince anyone of that but I just would like to think that I would've thought &quot;wtf is that... oh it's a drone&quot;</li>
<li>Plane: No, I've never seen shimmering lights like this on a regular plane</li>
</ul>
