## Reflection

- [[reflecting-on-romans-7-7-13#Round 5]]

## Wins

- time-boxing is definitely helpful, even with meetings going over and getting side-tracked
- The inflection point I mentioned in [[reflection-ai-work-and-adhd]] is continuing to flex... I noticed today decisions being made with the paramount motivation being "I am finally just tired of <what I've historically been doing in X>"
  - Feels like I'm taking just a few days of consistent steps in the direction that my "inner-man" wants to go. Inconsistencies persist, nothing for it but to keep stepping.
