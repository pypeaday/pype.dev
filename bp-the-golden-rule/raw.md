Matthew 7:12

```
So then, everything you desire that people do to you, so also you do to them, for this is the Torah and the Prophets
```

## What do I desire that people "do to [me]"?

1. Help if I need it - I want to live in a world where humans are helpful
2. Listen to me and understand what I say
3. Leave me alone sometimes

## What is the Torah and Prophets?

I know there's a lot more to where the texts come from and the varying
traditions in Judaism. But I think at a very high level, Jesus is saying that
we all know, deep down, how to live in harmony but that it requires sacrifice.
He calls us to live sacrificially _towards each other_, to live in Heaven
today, so we can experience the coming reality if our own resurrection
