  Video\n\n## Priests\n\nGod creates Eden in which he places humans to be his royal
  image - priests. God\nsets humans up to receive his blessing but humans choose their
  own way. The\npromise is for a priest and a sacrifice to come in Jesus.\n\nGod chooses
  Abraham and Sarah as the first royal priesthood as they are chosen\nby God to bless
  all the nations.\n\n## Melchizedek\n\nA priestly king of Salem. Melchizedek recognizes
  Yahweh as the God of gods -\nAbraham tithes to him and that's about the end of the
  story\n\nSalem is ancient short name for Jerusalem. \nAbraham's tithe to Melchizedek
  is just like the Israelite call to tithe to the\nLevites (priests) to support them.\n\n##
  Royal Family\n\nAbraham and Sarah are promised their own children but they take
  amtters into\ntheir own hands by scheming with Hagar. Eventually Sarah is given
  her own son,\nIssac, who God then calls for his life as a test of Abraham - it represents
  God\nchallenging Abraham to trust him with his own promise, and to not go his own\nway
  with Sarah\n\nDUring the Isaac sacrifice narrative a ram is given in place and Abraham
  names the place \"God will provide\".\n\n## Types\n\nThe story of God's call to
  sacrifice Isaac is much like the story of Abraham\nmeeting Melchizedek. In the Melchizedek
  story Abraham meets a priest on a high\nplace and gives him an offering. In the
  Isaac story Abraham acts as the priest\nand a ram is given to him by the LORD that
  covers the sins of Abraham's family.\n\n!!! note \"Atonement and Covering\"\n\n
  \   Covering the sin in this case looks much more like redemption and resolve\n
  \   rather than payment for gult, similar to a small-scale apology can cover a\n
  \   grievance even though no payment is made to make anything 'right', the\n    'covering'
  is simply a sign of forgiveness\n\n\n# Questions\n\n!!! note \"1\"\n\n    Shalem,
  or Salem, is later known as Jerusalem. Moriah, a mountainous region in\n    Jerusalem,
  is later called the \u201Cmount of the LORD\u201D (Genesis 22:14) and the\n    \u201Ctemple
  mount\u201D (2 Chronicles 3:1). With all of this in mind, compare Genesis\n    14:17-20
  with Genesis 22:1-14 . How do you see God providing for Abraham in\n    these similar
  settings?\n\n\n!!! scripture \"Genesis 22:14\"\n\n    14Abraham called the name
  of that place The Lord Will Provide, as it is\n    said to this day, \u201CIn the
  mount of the Lord it will be provided.\u201D\n\n!!! scripture \"2 Chronicles 3:1\"\n\n
  \   The Temple Construction in Jerusalem\n\n    1Then Solomon began to build the
  house of the Lord in Jerusalem on Mount\n    Moriah, where the Lord had appeared
  to his father David, at the place that\n    David had prepared on the threshing
  floor of Ornan the Jebusite.\n\n!!! scripture \"Genesis 14:17-20\"\n\n    God\u2019s
  Promise to Abram\n\n    17Then after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer
  and the kings who\n    were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at
  the valley of\n    Shaveh (that is, the King\u2019s Valley). 18And Melchizedek king
  of Salem\n    brought out bread and wine; now he was a priest of God Most High.
  19He\n    blessed him and said,\n\n    \u201CBlessed be Abram of God Most High,\n\n
  \   Possessor of heaven and earth;\n\n    20And blessed be God Most High,\n\n    Who
  has delivered your enemies into your hand.\u201D\n\n    He gave him a tenth of all.\n\n\n!!!
  scripture \"Genesis 22:1-14\"\n\n    The Offering of Isaac\n\n    1Now it came about
  after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to\n    him, \u201CAbraham!\u201D
  And he said, \u201CHere I am.\u201D 2He said, \u201CTake now your son,\n    your
  only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and\n    offer him
  there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will\n    tell you.\u201D
  3So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey,\n    and took two
  of his young men with him and Isaac his son; and he split wood\n    for the burnt
  offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had\n    told him. 4On the
  third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from\n    a distance. 5Abraham
  said to his young men, \u201CStay here with the donkey, and\n    I and the lad will
  go over there; and we will worship and return to you.\u201D\n    6Abraham took the
  wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son,\n    and he took in his
  hand the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked\n    on together. 7Isaac
  spoke to Abraham his father and said, \u201CMy father!\u201D And\n    he said, \u201CHere
  I am, my son.\u201D And he said, \u201CBehold, the fire and the wood,\n    but where
  is the lamb for the burnt offering?\u201D 8Abraham said, \u201CGod will\n    provide
  for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.\u201D So the two of\n    them
  walked on together. \n\n    9Then they came to the place of which God had told\n
  \   him; and Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood, and bound his\n
  \   son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. 10Abraham\n    stretched
  out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. 11But the angel\n    of the Lord
  called to him from heaven and said, \u201CAbraham, Abraham!\u201D And he\n    said,
  \u201CHere I am.\u201D 12He said, \u201CDo not stretch out your hand against the\n
  \   lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you\n    have
  not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.\u201D 13Then Abraham raised\n    his
  eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by\n    his
  horns; and Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt\n    offering
  in the place of his son. 14Abraham called the name of that place\n    The Lord Will
  Provide, as it is said to this day, \u201CIn the mount of the Lord\n    it will
  be provided.\u201D\n\n!!! success \"\"\n\n    5Abraham said to his young men, \u201CStay
  here with the donkey, and I and the\n    lad will go over there; and we will worship
  and return to you.\u201D\n\n| Genesis 14 | Genesis 22 | \n| --- | --- | \n| Melchizedek
  provides bread and wine | Yahweh provides the ram | \n| Yahweh gave Abram victory
  over Chedorlaomer | Yahweh gave Abraham Isaac's safety | \n\n!!! note \"3\"\n\n
  \   As you review Hebrews 7 , notice how the author assures their audience that\n
  \   Jesus is better than any other priest. What are some of the reasons the\n    author
  provides? How is this good news for everyone?\n\n!!! scripture \"Hebrews 7\"\n\n
  \   Melchizedek\u2019s Priesthood Like Christ\u2019s\n\n    1For this Melchizedek,
  king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning
  from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 2to whom also Abraham apportioned
  a tenth part of all the spoils, was first of all, by the translation of his name,
  king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace. 3Without
  father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor
  end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.\n\n
  \   4Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth
  of the choicest spoils. 5And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest\u2019s
  office have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is,
  from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham. 6But the one whose
  genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the
  one who had the promises. 7But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the
  greater. 8In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives
  them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives on. 9And, so to speak, through Abraham
  even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes, 10for he was still in the loins of
  his father when Melchizedek met him.\n\n    11Now if perfection was through the
  Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what
  further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek,
  and not be designated according to the order of Aaron? 12For when the priesthood
  is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also. 13For the one concerning
  whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated
  at the altar. 14For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe
  with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. 15And this is clearer
  still, if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek, 16who
  has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according
  to the power of an indestructible life. 17For it is attested of Him,\n\n    \u201CYou
  are a priest forever\n\n    According to the order of Melchizedek.\u201D\n\n    18For,
  on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its
  weakness and uselessness 19(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other
  hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.
  20And inasmuch as it was not without an oath 21(for they indeed became priests without
  an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him,\n\n    \u201CThe Lord
  has sworn\n\n    And will not change His mind,\n\n    \u2018You are a priest forever\u2019\u2009\u201D);\n\n
  \   22so much the more also Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.\n\n
  \   23The former priests, on the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they
  were prevented by death from continuing, 24but Jesus, on the other hand, because
  He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently. 25Therefore He is able also
  to save forever those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to
  make intercession for them.\n\n    26For it was fitting for us to have such a high
  priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the
  heavens; 27who does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices,
  first for His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did
  once for all when He offered up Himself. 28For the Law appoints men as high priests
  who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son,
  made perfect forever.\n\n1. Melchizedek was \"king of righteousness\" and \"kind
  of peace\", Jesus is a priest according to \"the order of Melchizedek\" and so seems
  to be that Jesus is the continued reigning king of righteousness and peace\n2. Melchizedek
  was priest of God Most High - the priestly order changed to Levi with the giving
  of the Law... Jesus represents, and _is_, another change in the priesthood which
  necessitates another change in law (verse 12). Jesus' kingship and priesthood is
  more similar to Melchizek's than Levi's (who was no king anyways).\n3. Levitical
  priesthood was not bound by an oath - but Jesus' priesthood is bound by Yahweh's
  oath to not change his mind, Jesus is priest forever\n4. Former priests, Levites,
  changed due to death, but Jesus persists forever (Melchizedek also presumably died)"

    the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who\nwere with him, the king of Sodom
    went out to meet him at the valley of\nShaveh (that is, the King\u2019s Valley).
    18And Melchizedek king of Salem\nbrought out bread and wine; now he was a priest
    of God Most High. 19He\nblessed him and said,</p>\n<p>\u201CBlessed be Abram of

    it came about after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to\nhim, \u201CAbraham!\u201D
    And he said, \u201CHere I am.\u201D 2He said, \u201CTake now your son,\nyour only
    son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and\noffer him there
    as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will\ntell you.\u201D 3So
    Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey,\nand took two of his
    young men with him and Isaac his son; and he split wood\nfor the burnt offering,
    and arose and went to the place of which God had\ntold him. 4On the third day
    Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from\na distance. 5Abraham said to his
    young men, \u201CStay here with the donkey, and\nI and the lad will go over there;
    and we will worship and return to you.\u201D\n6Abraham took the wood of the burnt
    offering and laid it on Isaac his son,\nand he took in his hand the fire and the
    knife. So the two of them walked\non together. 7Isaac spoke to Abraham his father
    and said, \u201CMy father!\u201D And\nhe said, \u201CHere I am, my son.\u201D
    And he said, \u201CBehold, the fire and the wood,\nbut where is the lamb for the
    burnt offering?\u201D 8Abraham said, \u201CGod will\nprovide for Himself the lamb
    for the burnt offering, my son.\u201D So the two of\nthem walked on together.</p>\n<p>9Then
    they came to the place of which God had told\nhim; and Abraham built the altar
    there and arranged the wood, and bound his\nson Isaac and laid him on the altar,
    on top of the wood. 10Abraham\nstretched out his hand and took the knife to slay
    his son. 11But the angel\nof the Lord called to him from heaven and said, \u201CAbraham,
    Abraham!\u201D And he\nsaid, \u201CHere I am.\u201D 12He said, \u201CDo not stretch
    out your hand against the\nlad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you
    fear God, since you\nhave not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.\u201D
    13Then Abraham raised\nhis eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught
    in the thicket by\nhis horns; and Abraham went and took the ram and offered him
    up for a burnt\noffering in the place of his son. 14Abraham called the name of

    class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">3</p>\n<p>As you review
    Hebrews 7 , notice how the author assures their audience that\nJesus is better
    than any other priest. What are some of the reasons the\nauthor provides? How
    is this good news for everyone?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Hebrews 7</p>\n<p>Melchizedek\u2019s Priesthood Like
    Christ\u2019s</p>\n<p>1For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most
    High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings
    and blessed him, 2to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils,
    was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then
    also king of Salem, which is king of peace. 3Without father, without mother, without
    genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the
    Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.</p>\n<p>4Now observe how great this
    man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils. 5And
    those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest\u2019s office have commandment
    in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although
    these are descended from Abraham. 6But the one whose genealogy is not traced from
    them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.
    7But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. 8In this case mortal
    men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed
    that he lives on. 9And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes,
    paid tithes, 10for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met
    him.</p>\n<p>11Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on
    the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for
    another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated
    according to the order of Aaron? 12For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity
    there takes place a change of law also. 13For the one concerning whom these things
    are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.
    14For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference
    to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. 15And this is clearer still,
    if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek, 16who has become
    such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power
    of an indestructible life. 17For it is attested of Him,</p>\n<p>\u201CYou are
    a priest forever</p>\n<p>According to the order of Melchizedek.\u201D</p>\n<p>18For,
    on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its
    weakness and uselessness 19(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other
    hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.
    20And inasmuch as it was not without an oath 21(for they indeed became priests
    without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him,</p>\n<p>\u201CThe
    Lord has sworn</p>\n<p>And will not change His mind,</p>\n<p>\u2018You are a priest
    forever\u2019\u2009\u201D);</p>\n<p>22so much the more also Jesus has become the
    guarantee of a better covenant.</p>\n<p>23The former priests, on the one hand,
    existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing,
    24but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood
    permanently. 25Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to
    God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.</p>\n<p>26For
    it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated
    from sinners and exalted above the heavens; 27who does not need daily, like those
    high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the
    sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.
    28For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath,
    which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever.</p>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Melchizedek
    was &quot;king of righteousness&quot; and &quot;kind of peace&quot;, Jesus is
    a priest according to &quot;the order of Melchizedek&quot; and so seems to be
    that Jesus is the continued reigning king of righteousness and peace</li>\n<li>Melchizedek
    was priest of God Most High - the priestly order changed to Levi with the giving
    of the Law... Jesus represents, and <em>is</em>, another change in the priesthood
    which necessitates another change in law (verse 12). Jesus' kingship and priesthood
    is more similar to Melchizek's than Levi's (who was no king anyways).</li>\n<li>Levitical
    priesthood was not bound by an oath - but Jesus' priesthood is bound by Yahweh's
    oath to not change his mind, Jesus is priest forever</li>\n<li>Former priests,
    Levites, changed due to death, but Jesus persists forever (Melchizedek also presumably
    died)</li>\n</ol>\n\n        </section>\n    </article>\n</section>        </div>\n

    also king of Salem, which is king of peace. 3Without father, without mother, without
    genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the
    Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.</p>\n<p>4Now observe how great this
    man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils. 5And
    those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest\u2019s office have commandment
    in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although
    these are descended from Abraham. 6But the one whose genealogy is not traced from
    them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.
    7But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. 8In this case mortal
    men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed
    that he lives on. 9And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes,
    paid tithes, 10for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met
    him.</p>\n<p>11Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on
    the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for
    another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated
    according to the order of Aaron? 12For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity
    there takes place a change of law also. 13For the one concerning whom these things
    are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.
    14For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference
    to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. 15And this is clearer still,
    if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek, 16who has become
    such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power
    of an indestructible life. 17For it is attested of Him,</p>\n<p>\u201CYou are
    a priest forever</p>\n<p>According to the order of Melchizedek.\u201D</p>\n<p>18For,
    on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its
    weakness and uselessness 19(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other
    hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.
    20And inasmuch as it was not without an oath 21(for they indeed became priests
    without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him,</p>\n<p>\u201CThe
    Lord has sworn</p>\n<p>And will not change His mind,</p>\n<p>\u2018You are a priest
    forever\u2019\u2009\u201D);</p>\n<p>22so much the more also Jesus has become the
    guarantee of a better covenant.</p>\n<p>23The former priests, on the one hand,
    existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing,
    24but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood
    permanently. 25Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to
    God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.</p>\n<p>26For
    it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated
    from sinners and exalted above the heavens; 27who does not need daily, like those
    high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the
    sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.
    28For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath,
    which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever.</p>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Melchizedek
    was &quot;king of righteousness&quot; and &quot;kind of peace&quot;, Jesus is
    a priest according to &quot;the order of Melchizedek&quot; and so seems to be
    that Jesus is the continued reigning king of righteousness and peace</li>\n<li>Melchizedek
    was priest of God Most High - the priestly order changed to Levi with the giving
    of the Law... Jesus represents, and <em>is</em>, another change in the priesthood
    which necessitates another change in law (verse 12). Jesus' kingship and priesthood
    is more similar to Melchizek's than Levi's (who was no king anyways).</li>\n<li>Levitical
    priesthood was not bound by an oath - but Jesus' priesthood is bound by Yahweh's
    oath to not change his mind, Jesus is priest forever</li>\n<li>Former priests,
    Levites, changed due to death, but Jesus persists forever (Melchizedek also presumably
    died)</li>\n</ol>\n\n        </section>\n    </article>\n</section>"

    class=\"admonition-title\">Hebrews 7</p>\n<p>Melchizedek\u2019s Priesthood Like
    Christ\u2019s</p>\n<p>1For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most
    High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings
    and blessed him, 2to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils,
    was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then
    also king of Salem, which is king of peace. 3Without father, without mother, without
    genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the
    Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.</p>\n<p>4Now observe how great this
    man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils. 5And
    those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest\u2019s office have commandment
    in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their brethren, although
    these are descended from Abraham. 6But the one whose genealogy is not traced from
    them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.
    7But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater. 8In this case mortal
    men receive tithes, but in that case one receives them, of whom it is witnessed
    that he lives on. 9And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who received tithes,
    paid tithes, 10for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met
    him.</p>\n<p>11Now if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on
    the basis of it the people received the Law), what further need was there for
    another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not be designated
    according to the order of Aaron? 12For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity
    there takes place a change of law also. 13For the one concerning whom these things
    are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.
    14For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference
    to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests. 15And this is clearer still,
    if another priest arises according to the likeness of Melchizedek, 16who has become
    such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement, but according to the power
    of an indestructible life. 17For it is attested of Him,</p>\n<p>\u201CYou are
    a priest forever</p>\n<p>According to the order of Melchizedek.\u201D</p>\n<p>18For,
    on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because of its
    weakness and uselessness 19(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the other
    hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.
    20And inasmuch as it was not without an oath 21(for they indeed became priests
    without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him,</p>\n<p>\u201CThe
    Lord has sworn</p>\n<p>And will not change His mind,</p>\n<p>\u2018You are a priest
    forever\u2019\u2009\u201D);</p>\n<p>22so much the more also Jesus has become the
    guarantee of a better covenant.</p>\n<p>23The former priests, on the one hand,
    existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing,
    24but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood
    permanently. 25Therefore He is able also to save forever those who draw near to
    God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.</p>\n<p>26For
    it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated
    from sinners and exalted above the heavens; 27who does not need daily, like those
    high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the
    sins of the people, because this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.
    28For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak, but the word of the oath,
    which came after the Law, appoints a Son, made perfect forever.</p>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>Melchizedek
    was &quot;king of righteousness&quot; and &quot;kind of peace&quot;, Jesus is
    a priest according to &quot;the order of Melchizedek&quot; and so seems to be
    that Jesus is the continued reigning king of righteousness and peace</li>\n<li>Melchizedek
    was priest of God Most High - the priestly order changed to Levi with the giving
    of the Law... Jesus represents, and <em>is</em>, another change in the priesthood
    which necessitates another change in law (verse 12). Jesus' kingship and priesthood
    is more similar to Melchizek's than Levi's (who was no king anyways).</li>\n<li>Levitical
    priesthood was not bound by an oath - but Jesus' priesthood is bound by Yahweh's
    oath to not change his mind, Jesus is priest forever</li>\n<li>Former priests,
    Levites, changed due to death, but Jesus persists forever (Melchizedek also presumably
    died)</li>\n</ol>\n\n        </div>\n    </main>\n</div>\n     </body>\n</html>"

    Video\n\n## Priests\n\nGod creates Eden in which he places humans to be his royal
    image - priests. God\nsets humans up to receive his blessing but humans choose
    their own way. The\npromise is for a priest and a sacrifice to come in Jesus.\n\nGod
    chooses Abraham and Sarah as the first royal priesthood as they are chosen\nby
    God to bless all the nations.\n\n## Melchizedek\n\nA priestly king of Salem. Melchizedek
    recognizes Yahweh as the God of gods -\nAbraham tithes to him and that's about
    the end of the story\n\nSalem is ancient short name for Jerusalem. \nAbraham's
    tithe to Melchizedek is just like the Israelite call to tithe to the\nLevites
    (priests) to support them.\n\n## Royal Family\n\nAbraham and Sarah are promised
    their own children but they take amtters into\ntheir own hands by scheming with
    Hagar. Eventually Sarah is given her own son,\nIssac, who God then calls for his
    life as a test of Abraham - it represents God\nchallenging Abraham to trust him
    with his own promise, and to not go his own\nway with Sarah\n\nDUring the Isaac
    sacrifice narrative a ram is given in place and Abraham names the place \"God
    will provide\".\n\n## Types\n\nThe story of God's call to sacrifice Isaac is much
    like the story of Abraham\nmeeting Melchizedek. In the Melchizedek story Abraham
    meets a priest on a high\nplace and gives him an offering. In the Isaac story
    Abraham acts as the priest\nand a ram is given to him by the LORD that covers
    the sins of Abraham's family.\n\n!!! note \"Atonement and Covering\"\n\n    Covering
    the sin in this case looks much more like redemption and resolve\n    rather than
    payment for gult, similar to a small-scale apology can cover a\n    grievance
    even though no payment is made to make anything 'right', the\n    'covering' is
    simply a sign of forgiveness\n\n\n# Questions\n\n!!! note \"1\"\n\n    Shalem,

    this good news for everyone?\n\n!!! scripture \"Hebrews 7\"\n\n    Melchizedek\u2019s
    Priesthood Like Christ\u2019s\n\n    1For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest
    of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of
    the kings and blessed him, 2to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all
    the spoils, was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness,
    and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace. 3Without father, without
    mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but
    made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.\n\n    4Now observe
    how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest
    spoils. 5And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the priest\u2019s office
    have commandment in the Law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from
    their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham. 6But the one whose
    genealogy is not traced from them collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the
    one who had the promises. 7But without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the
    greater. 8In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case one receives
    them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives on. 9And, so to speak, through Abraham
    even Levi, who received tithes, paid tithes, 10for he was still in the loins of
    his father when Melchizedek met him.\n\n    11Now if perfection was through the
    Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what
    further need was there for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek,
    and not be designated according to the order of Aaron? 12For when the priesthood
    is changed, of necessity there takes place a change of law also. 13For the one
    concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no
    one has officiated at the altar. 14For it is evident that our Lord was descended
    from Judah, a tribe with reference to which Moses spoke nothing concerning priests.
    15And this is clearer still, if another priest arises according to the likeness
    of Melchizedek, 16who has become such not on the basis of a law of physical requirement,
    but according to the power of an indestructible life. 17For it is attested of
    Him,\n\n    \u201CYou are a priest forever\n\n    According to the order of Melchizedek.\u201D\n\n
    \   18For, on the one hand, there is a setting aside of a former commandment because
    of its weakness and uselessness 19(for the Law made nothing perfect), and on the
    other hand there is a bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near
    to God. 20And inasmuch as it was not without an oath 21(for they indeed became
    priests without an oath, but He with an oath through the One who said to Him,\n\n
    \   \u201CThe Lord has sworn\n\n    And will not change His mind,\n\n    \u2018You
    are a priest forever\u2019\u2009\u201D);\n\n    22so much the more also Jesus
    has become the guarantee of a better covenant.\n\n    23The former priests, on
    the one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death
    from continuing, 24but Jesus, on the other hand, because He continues forever,
    holds His priesthood permanently. 25Therefore He is able also to save forever
    those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession
    for them.\n\n    26For it was fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy,
    innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners and exalted above the heavens; 27who
    does not need daily, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices, first for
    His own sins and then for the sins of the people, because this He did once for
    all when He offered up Himself. 28For the Law appoints men as high priests who
    are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, appoints a Son,
    made perfect forever.\n\n1. Melchizedek was \"king of righteousness\" and \"kind
    of peace\", Jesus is a priest according to \"the order of Melchizedek\" and so
    seems to be that Jesus is the continued reigning king of righteousness and peace\n2.
    Melchizedek was priest of God Most High - the priestly order changed to Levi with
    the giving of the Law... Jesus represents, and _is_, another change in the priesthood
    which necessitates another change in law (verse 12). Jesus' kingship and priesthood
    is more similar to Melchizek's than Levi's (who was no king anyways).\n3. Levitical
    priesthood was not bound by an oath - but Jesus' priesthood is bound by Yahweh's
    oath to not change his mind, Jesus is priest forever\n4. Former priests, Levites,
    changed due to death, but Jesus persists forever (Melchizedek also presumably
    died)\n\n"

## Priests

God creates Eden in which he places humans to be his royal image - priests. God
sets humans up to receive his blessing but humans choose their own way. The
promise is for a priest and a sacrifice to come in Jesus.

God chooses Abraham and Sarah as the first royal priesthood as they are chosen
by God to bless all the nations.

## Melchizedek

A priestly king of Salem. Melchizedek recognizes Yahweh as the God of gods -
Abraham tithes to him and that's about the end of the story

Salem is ancient short name for Jerusalem. 
Abraham's tithe to Melchizedek is just like the Israelite call to tithe to the
Levites (priests) to support them.

## Royal Family

Abraham and Sarah are promised their own children but they take amtters into
their own hands by scheming with Hagar. Eventually Sarah is given her own son,
Issac, who God then calls for his life as a test of Abraham - it represents God
challenging Abraham to trust him with his own promise, and to not go his own
way with Sarah

DUring the Isaac sacrifice narrative a ram is given in place and Abraham names the place "God will provide".

## Types

The story of God's call to sacrifice Isaac is much like the story of Abraham
meeting Melchizedek. In the Melchizedek story Abraham meets a priest on a high
place and gives him an offering. In the Isaac story Abraham acts as the priest
and a ram is given to him by the LORD that covers the sins of Abraham's family.

!!! note "Atonement and Covering"

    Covering the sin in this case looks much more like redemption and resolve
    rather than payment for gult, similar to a small-scale apology can cover a
    grievance even though no payment is made to make anything 'right', the
    'covering' is simply a sign of forgiveness


# Questions

!!! note "1"

    Shalem, or Salem, is later known as Jerusalem. Moriah, a mountainous region in
    Jerusalem, is later called the “mount of the LORD” (Genesis 22:14) and the
    “temple mount” (2 Chronicles 3:1). With all of this in mind, compare Genesis
    14:17-20 with Genesis 22:1-14 . How do you see God providing for Abraham in
    these similar settings?


!!! scripture "Genesis 22:14"

    14Abraham called the name of that place The Lord Will Provide, as it is
    said to this day, “In the mount of the Lord it will be provided.”

!!! scripture "2 Chronicles 3:1"

    The Temple Construction in Jerusalem

    1Then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord in Jerusalem on Mount
    Moriah, where the Lord had appeared to his father David, at the place that
    David had prepared on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.

    God’s Promise to Abram

    17Then after his return from the defeat of Chedorlaomer and the kings who
    were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the valley of
    Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley). 18And Melchizedek king of Salem
    brought out bread and wine; now he was a priest of God Most High. 19He
    blessed him and said,

    “Blessed be Abram of God Most High,

    Possessor of heaven and earth;

    20And blessed be God Most High,

    Who has delivered your enemies into your hand.”

    He gave him a tenth of all.


!!! scripture "Genesis 22:1-14"

    The Offering of Isaac

    1Now it came about after these things, that God tested Abraham, and said to
    him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Here I am.” 2He said, “Take now your son,
    your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and
    offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I will
    tell you.” 3So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey,
    and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son; and he split wood
    for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had
    told him. 4On the third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw the place from
    a distance. 5Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey, and
    I and the lad will go over there; and we will worship and return to you.”
    6Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on Isaac his son,
    and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked
    on together. 7Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “My father!” And
    he said, “Here I am, my son.” And he said, “Behold, the fire and the wood,
    but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” 8Abraham said, “God will
    provide for Himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” So the two of
    them walked on together. 

    9Then they came to the place of which God had told
    him; and Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood, and bound his
    son Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. 10Abraham
    stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. 11But the angel
    of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” And he
    said, “Here I am.” 12He said, “Do not stretch out your hand against the
    lad, and do nothing to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you
    have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.” 13Then Abraham raised
    his eyes and looked, and behold, behind him a ram caught in the thicket by
    his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt
    offering in the place of his son. 14Abraham called the name of that place
    The Lord Will Provide, as it is said to this day, “In the mount of the Lord
    it will be provided.”

    As you review Hebrews 7 , notice how the author assures their audience that
    Jesus is better than any other priest. What are some of the reasons the
    author provides? How is this good news for everyone?

!!! scripture "Hebrews 7"

    Melchizedek’s Priesthood Like Christ’s

    1For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him, 2to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils, was first of all, by the translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace. 3Without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.
