- [ ] Andrew's sermon today had several good points I want to meditate on.
  - biblical friendship
- [ ] Notes on obedience with kids and my patterns for instruction
  1. I talk about obedience a lot, but I should to it with more focus on grace and love, not so much _during_ the girls being disobedient
  2. I need to use the word shema with the girls - help adorn them with the fear of the Lord. deut 6 and proverbs 1

## Projects to touch

- [[thoughts-to-nostr]]

  lightweight project management

## Wins
