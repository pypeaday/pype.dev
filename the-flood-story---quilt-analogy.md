content: "# The Flood Story in the Hebrew Bible\n\nI'm slowly making my way through
  some Bible Project classes online because Tim\nMackie is a fantastic teacher and
  BP has done be a _great_ service by opening\nmy eyes to the reality of the Biblical
  narrative and what it means for my life\nof faith in Jesus.\n\nThe second session
  is filled with great points and 10 minutes in I had to jot\nthis one down...\n\n##
  A Quilt as History\n\nImagine your grandmother's grandmother made a quilt, and passed
  it down the\nfamily tree. In a sense, that quilt contains history that would pre-date
  you\nbut would absolutely have meaning to you... However, you might look for meaning\nthat
  was never intended to be present.\n\nThe pieces of the quilt have their own history
  - there will be material that\nmight've been part of a dress, or curtains, or bedsheets,
  or anything else\nsomeone in the family tree found interesting and meaningful for
  the story they\nare telling with their quilt.\n\nThe question of what each of the
  pieces mean on their own, or in where they\ncome from is interesting perhaps, but
  it's not the same question as asking what\nthose pieces mean now that they have
  been curated into the family quilt... The\ncreator(s) of the quilt may repurpose
  those pieces entirely, and it wouldn't be\n\"right\" for you or me to be upset that
  one piece of the quilt came from an\narticle of clothing or cloth associated with
  something we might not like - the\nauthor (your grandma) __repurposed__ it for that
  very reason, to change the\nmeaning and communicate something to you, perhaps something
  totally different\nthan what that cloth might've meant before it was added to the
  quilt.\n\n## Creation as a Quilt\n\nThe quilt is a curated piece of pieces of fabric
  - and to bring the metaphor\nhome very abruptly, so is the Hebrew Bible... the authors
  of the Hebrew\nscripture absolutely repurposed stories and images that were present
  in their\ntime and before, but not to make something that is a cheap copy, but to\ncommunicate
  the story of the *actual* God of gods, ruling over the world. \n\nFor example -
  the very beginning of the creationa ccount in Genesis 1 has the\nspirit of God hovering
  over the waters. Without getting into more details than\na short write-up warrants,
  the waters in ancient thought represent chaos. Not\nonly that, but there is an older
  creation account called the Enuma Elish where\ntheir savior god, Marduk, fights
  the chaos waters (Tiamat) and conquers her\neventually... The thing about the Hebrew
  narrative is that Yahweh doesn't have\nto fight the waters... he subdues with his
  words because he isn't in tension\nwith creation, or even with chaos, all things
  obey him and the chaos waters\nthat other gods had to fight and die over are no
  different. So the meaning of\nthe waters is somewhat consistent across lots of cultures,
  but Hebrews took the\nstories and in essence made them \"more true\", but at the
  very least made them\nrelevant to the story they are/were communicating about the
  God of gods and\nLord of love - that he is the creator of all things and invites
  us to partner\nwith him (as his image-bearers).\n\n## Calm Down\n\nA lot of Christians
  get upset or skiddish when other stories and cultures get\nbrought up - as if the
  Bible had to fall from heaven in their favorite English\ntranslation... but in my
  opinion that is the silliest and cheapest view of the\nWord of God... he chose people
  out of foreign lands to make an inheritence for\nhimself, his people, and those
  people tell his story using images that they\nknow.\n\nIt's important for us to
  answer interesting questions but not lose sight of\nwhat's important... The Enuma
  Elish is an interesting piece, and there's\nparallels with the Hebrew bible, but
  the Hebrew creation account clearly\ncommunicates that Yahweh doesn't have to labor
  and fight for order, he speaks\norder into chaos. That lesson is wholly different
  from other creation\nnarratives, but is it derivative of them... \n\nThat used to
  bother me, but understanding that the authors of the Bible,\ncarried forth by the
  guidance of God's spirit, curated these stories and\nnarratives for God's people
  to communicate the truest Truths about him and his\nlove for people help me understand
  the reality of God partnering with humanity\n- which starts in the Garden and is
  how Revelation ends"

    grandmother made a quilt, and passed it down the\nfamily tree. In a sense, that
    quilt contains history that would pre-date you\nbut would absolutely have meaning
    to you... However, you might look for meaning\nthat was never intended to be present.</p>\n<p>The
    pieces of the quilt have their own history - there will be material that\nmight've
    been part of a dress, or curtains, or bedsheets, or anything else\nsomeone in
    the family tree found interesting and meaningful for the story they\nare telling
    with their quilt.</p>\n<p>The question of what each of the pieces mean on their
    own, or in where they\ncome from is interesting perhaps, but it's not the same
    question as asking what\nthose pieces mean now that they have been curated into
    the family quilt... The\ncreator(s) of the quilt may repurpose those pieces entirely,
    and it wouldn't be\n&quot;right&quot; for you or me to be upset that one piece
    of the quilt came from an\narticle of clothing or cloth associated with something
    we might not like - the\nauthor (your grandma) <strong>repurposed</strong> it
    for that very reason, to change the\nmeaning and communicate something to you,
    perhaps something totally different\nthan what that cloth might've meant before
    it was added to the quilt.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creation-as-a-quilt\">Creation as a Quilt

    piece of pieces of fabric - and to bring the metaphor\nhome very abruptly, so
    is the Hebrew Bible... the authors of the Hebrew\nscripture absolutely repurposed
    stories and images that were present in their\ntime and before, but not to make
    something that is a cheap copy, but to\ncommunicate the story of the <em>actual</em>
    God of gods, ruling over the world.</p>\n<p>For example - the very beginning of
    the creationa ccount in Genesis 1 has the\nspirit of God hovering over the waters.
    Without getting into more details than\na short write-up warrants, the waters
    in ancient thought represent chaos. Not\nonly that, but there is an older creation
    account called the Enuma Elish where\ntheir savior god, Marduk, fights the chaos
    waters (Tiamat) and conquers her\neventually... The thing about the Hebrew narrative
    is that Yahweh doesn't have\nto fight the waters... he subdues with his words
    because he isn't in tension\nwith creation, or even with chaos, all things obey
    him and the chaos waters\nthat other gods had to fight and die over are no different.
    So the meaning of\nthe waters is somewhat consistent across lots of cultures,
    but Hebrews took the\nstories and in essence made them &quot;more true&quot;,
    but at the very least made them\nrelevant to the story they are/were communicating
    about the God of gods and\nLord of love - that he is the creator of all things
    and invites us to partner\nwith him (as his image-bearers).</p>\n<h2 id=\"calm-down\">Calm

    get upset or skiddish when other stories and cultures get\nbrought up - as if
    the Bible had to fall from heaven in their favorite English\ntranslation... but
    in my opinion that is the silliest and cheapest view of the\nWord of God... he
    chose people out of foreign lands to make an inheritence for\nhimself, his people,
    and those people tell his story using images that they\nknow.</p>\n<p>It's important
    for us to answer interesting questions but not lose sight of\nwhat's important...
    The Enuma Elish is an interesting piece, and there's\nparallels with the Hebrew
    bible, but the Hebrew creation account clearly\ncommunicates that Yahweh doesn't
    have to labor and fight for order, he speaks\norder into chaos. That lesson is
    wholly different from other creation\nnarratives, but is it derivative of them...</p>\n<p>That
    used to bother me, but understanding that the authors of the Bible,\ncarried forth

    grandmother made a quilt, and passed it down the\nfamily tree. In a sense, that
    quilt contains history that would pre-date you\nbut would absolutely have meaning
    to you... However, you might look for meaning\nthat was never intended to be present.</p>\n<p>The
    pieces of the quilt have their own history - there will be material that\nmight've
    been part of a dress, or curtains, or bedsheets, or anything else\nsomeone in
    the family tree found interesting and meaningful for the story they\nare telling
    with their quilt.</p>\n<p>The question of what each of the pieces mean on their
    own, or in where they\ncome from is interesting perhaps, but it's not the same
    question as asking what\nthose pieces mean now that they have been curated into
    the family quilt... The\ncreator(s) of the quilt may repurpose those pieces entirely,
    and it wouldn't be\n&quot;right&quot; for you or me to be upset that one piece
    of the quilt came from an\narticle of clothing or cloth associated with something
    we might not like - the\nauthor (your grandma) <strong>repurposed</strong> it
    for that very reason, to change the\nmeaning and communicate something to you,
    perhaps something totally different\nthan what that cloth might've meant before
    it was added to the quilt.</p>\n<h2 id=\"creation-as-a-quilt\">Creation as a Quilt

    piece of pieces of fabric - and to bring the metaphor\nhome very abruptly, so
    is the Hebrew Bible... the authors of the Hebrew\nscripture absolutely repurposed
    stories and images that were present in their\ntime and before, but not to make
    something that is a cheap copy, but to\ncommunicate the story of the <em>actual</em>
    God of gods, ruling over the world.</p>\n<p>For example - the very beginning of
    the creationa ccount in Genesis 1 has the\nspirit of God hovering over the waters.
    Without getting into more details than\na short write-up warrants, the waters
    in ancient thought represent chaos. Not\nonly that, but there is an older creation
    account called the Enuma Elish where\ntheir savior god, Marduk, fights the chaos
    waters (Tiamat) and conquers her\neventually... The thing about the Hebrew narrative
    is that Yahweh doesn't have\nto fight the waters... he subdues with his words
    because he isn't in tension\nwith creation, or even with chaos, all things obey
    him and the chaos waters\nthat other gods had to fight and die over are no different.
    So the meaning of\nthe waters is somewhat consistent across lots of cultures,
    but Hebrews took the\nstories and in essence made them &quot;more true&quot;,
    but at the very least made them\nrelevant to the story they are/were communicating
    about the God of gods and\nLord of love - that he is the creator of all things
    and invites us to partner\nwith him (as his image-bearers).</p>\n<h2 id=\"calm-down\">Calm

    get upset or skiddish when other stories and cultures get\nbrought up - as if
    the Bible had to fall from heaven in their favorite English\ntranslation... but
    in my opinion that is the silliest and cheapest view of the\nWord of God... he
    chose people out of foreign lands to make an inheritence for\nhimself, his people,
    and those people tell his story using images that they\nknow.</p>\n<p>It's important
    for us to answer interesting questions but not lose sight of\nwhat's important...
    The Enuma Elish is an interesting piece, and there's\nparallels with the Hebrew
    bible, but the Hebrew creation account clearly\ncommunicates that Yahweh doesn't
    have to labor and fight for order, he speaks\norder into chaos. That lesson is
    wholly different from other creation\nnarratives, but is it derivative of them...</p>\n<p>That
    used to bother me, but understanding that the authors of the Bible,\ncarried forth
    by the guidance of God's spirit, curated these stories and\nnarratives for God's
    people to communicate the truest Truths about him and his\nlove for people help
    me understand the reality of God partnering with humanity</p>\n<ul>\n<li>which

# The Flood Story in the Hebrew Bible

I'm slowly making my way through some Bible Project classes online because Tim
Mackie is a fantastic teacher and BP has done be a _great_ service by opening
my eyes to the reality of the Biblical narrative and what it means for my life
of faith in Jesus.

The second session is filled with great points and 10 minutes in I had to jot
this one down...

## A Quilt as History

Imagine your grandmother's grandmother made a quilt, and passed it down the
family tree. In a sense, that quilt contains history that would pre-date you
but would absolutely have meaning to you... However, you might look for meaning
that was never intended to be present.

The pieces of the quilt have their own history - there will be material that
might've been part of a dress, or curtains, or bedsheets, or anything else
someone in the family tree found interesting and meaningful for the story they
are telling with their quilt.

The question of what each of the pieces mean on their own, or in where they
come from is interesting perhaps, but it's not the same question as asking what
those pieces mean now that they have been curated into the family quilt... The
creator(s) of the quilt may repurpose those pieces entirely, and it wouldn't be
"right" for you or me to be upset that one piece of the quilt came from an
article of clothing or cloth associated with something we might not like - the
author (your grandma) __repurposed__ it for that very reason, to change the
meaning and communicate something to you, perhaps something totally different
than what that cloth might've meant before it was added to the quilt.

## Creation as a Quilt

The quilt is a curated piece of pieces of fabric - and to bring the metaphor
home very abruptly, so is the Hebrew Bible... the authors of the Hebrew
scripture absolutely repurposed stories and images that were present in their
time and before, but not to make something that is a cheap copy, but to
communicate the story of the *actual* God of gods, ruling over the world. 

For example - the very beginning of the creationa ccount in Genesis 1 has the
spirit of God hovering over the waters. Without getting into more details than
a short write-up warrants, the waters in ancient thought represent chaos. Not
only that, but there is an older creation account called the Enuma Elish where
their savior god, Marduk, fights the chaos waters (Tiamat) and conquers her
eventually... The thing about the Hebrew narrative is that Yahweh doesn't have
to fight the waters... he subdues with his words because he isn't in tension
with creation, or even with chaos, all things obey him and the chaos waters
that other gods had to fight and die over are no different. So the meaning of
the waters is somewhat consistent across lots of cultures, but Hebrews took the
stories and in essence made them "more true", but at the very least made them
relevant to the story they are/were communicating about the God of gods and
Lord of love - that he is the creator of all things and invites us to partner
with him (as his image-bearers).

## Calm Down

A lot of Christians get upset or skiddish when other stories and cultures get
brought up - as if the Bible had to fall from heaven in their favorite English
translation... but in my opinion that is the silliest and cheapest view of the
Word of God... he chose people out of foreign lands to make an inheritence for
himself, his people, and those people tell his story using images that they
know.

It's important for us to answer interesting questions but not lose sight of
what's important... The Enuma Elish is an interesting piece, and there's
parallels with the Hebrew bible, but the Hebrew creation account clearly
communicates that Yahweh doesn't have to labor and fight for order, he speaks
order into chaos. That lesson is wholly different from other creation
narratives, but is it derivative of them... 

That used to bother me, but understanding that the authors of the Bible,
carried forth by the guidance of God's spirit, curated these stories and
narratives for God's people to communicate the truest Truths about him and his
love for people help me understand the reality of God partnering with humanity
- which starts in the Garden and is how Revelation ends
