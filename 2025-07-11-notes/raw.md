yesterday [[2025-07-10-notes]]

I am continuing to work on my dev experience a little bit... it's been a long
time since I got into it but I'm very spread out now so I need to get some
minimized commmonization going across my environments:

1. 3 computers
2. 2.5 editors: neovim, vs code, vs code + roo, windsurf
3. scattered blogging utilities (links, graphs, etc)

So I'm using LLMs to help me clean up dotfiles, and then I'll probably try to
get my keymaps from tmux working in windsurf... they work in vs code OK, i
probably have a few pain points, but when I'm in windsurf, although that's
mostly the AI writing code, I need to edit things sometimes and my vim keymaps
are all messed up. I usually open the file in neovim to make the edit but it'd
be nice to stay in whichever tool I'm in for the task I'm working on

## Working on

- [[thoughts-to-nostr]] is coming along great, I have the oldest thoughts being posted via temporal workflow and activities now
- setup [[jellyfin]] post stub
- I still want to clean up my dotfiles a bit and hone in on the vs code and
  windsurf keymaps issues... plus a few settings issues with git and the project
  manager extension

## Wins

- learned [[lua-type-hinting-undefined-global]]
- wrote about [[the-homelab]] and [[ghost]]
- my daily-notes nvim plugin is working really nicely - [[daily-notes-neovim-plugin]]
