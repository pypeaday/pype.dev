content: "I'm a dad and I have 2 beautiful daughters in my house right now. As they've\ngrown
  up just a little from new-born to toddler to child, my wife and I have\nworked hard
  to have the right posture and attitude towards \"discipline\". I have\nnoticed that
  3 words seem to kind of meld into each other and I prefer they\nhave clear boundaries,
  because in our household we're very intentional to not\npunish... Punishment is
  a heavy and weighty thing and we don't want our kids to\ngrow up thinking they get
  punished for messing up.\n\nKids certainly **know** right and wrong to some degree,
  and even when they\nknowingly do something \"bad\" it's not necessarily that there
  was malicious\nintent behind it... In my mind - 'punishment' is for malpractice,
  but erroring\nand making an unwise choice to \"do something bad\" is a lack of judgement
  and\nthat doesn't require punishment, it should illicit discipline.\n\nWhy be so
  pedantic about these 2 words in particular? Well because I don't\nthink it's appropriate
  for my daughters to believe they get punished for\nsinging at the table... There's
  nothing morally wrong with that, but we do need\nthem to focus on meals at meal
  time, so we practice being disciplined at the\ntable. If they continue to sing,
  we utilitze consequences but they are never\npenal. What I mean is that if my kids
  are singing, being loud, etc. at the\ntable, we have them run laps outside or do
  jumping jacks. Why? Because getting\nthat excess energy out is a way for them to
  discipline their bodies, and learn\nto be self-controlled. There's no element of
  fear or of losing something\nbecause they're struggling to contain themselves while
  we eat.\n\n!!! note \"punishment vs discipline\"\n\n    That's the key difference
  and it's taken several years for me to really drive a\n    wedge between \"punishment\"
  and \"discipline\" even in my own worldview as a\n    parent. So our language with
  our kids is \"obey the rules or we will do some\n    discipline\" - never \"or you
  will be punished\".\n\nDo you see the difference in how that frames even the obedience
  and the rule\nitself? It's not a thing to follow out of fear, rules are to be followed\n**because
  it's right** and to do what is right requires discipline and\nself-control. There
  is no need (actually there's not even an appropriate place)\nfor **punishment**
  in this context.\n\nSo what of consequences? Well, sometimes punishment is a consequence,
  sometimes\nrunning laps is a consequence, sometimes getting hurt from falling out
  of a\ntree you weren't supposed to be climbing that high in is a consequence...\nConsequences
  are amoral things that happen after something else. But\nconsequences presented
  without a framework for understanding them can sort of\nmake them meaningless.\n\nFor
  a while I would tell my girls that \"there will be consequences for\ndisobeying\",
  but this isn't enough - this doesn't explain _why_ there are\nconsequenes, it only
  encoruages obedience to avoid **punishment** rather than\nobedience **because it
  is right**.\n\nSo that's a short parenting note that I've been musing on - kids
  need to grow\nup learning how to be disciplined and how to be self-controlled. Raising
  them\nto avoid punishment teaches nothing about the socieatal expectation of\nappropriate
  behavior but rather puts them in a position of just trying to avoid\nsomething uncomfortable.
  That doesn't raise them towards something good, it\nonly teaches them to avoid something
  else.\n\nIf instead my children understand **that it is important** to be a disciplined\nhuman,
  it fosters a relatonship of help and love between us. My job isn't to\npunish my
  kids for misbehaving, it's to raise them to be disciplined,\nhonorable, well-meaning
  people in a society. If I'm their teacher and guide\nthen that journey is filled
  with learning and love. If I only arbitrate justice\nthrough negative consequences
  and punishment, then what room is there in their\nhearts to love me as their dad
  if they're always afraid I'm going to punish\nthem for something?"

    need\nthem to focus on meals at meal time, so we practice being disciplined at
    the\ntable. If they continue to sing, we utilitze consequences but they are never\npenal.
    What I mean is that if my kids are singing, being loud, etc. at the\ntable, we
    have them run laps outside or do jumping jacks. Why? Because getting\nthat excess
    energy out is a way for them to discipline their bodies, and learn\nto be self-controlled.
    There's no element of fear or of losing something\nbecause they're struggling
    to contain themselves while we eat.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">punishment
    vs discipline</p>\n<p>That's the key difference and it's taken several years for
    me to really drive a\nwedge between &quot;punishment&quot; and &quot;discipline&quot;
    even in my own worldview as a\nparent. So our language with our kids is &quot;obey
    the rules or we will do some\ndiscipline&quot; - never &quot;or you will be punished&quot;.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Do
    you see the difference in how that frames even the obedience and the rule\nitself?
    It's not a thing to follow out of fear, rules are to be followed\n<strong>because
    it's right</strong> and to do what is right requires discipline and\nself-control.
    There is no need (actually there's not even an appropriate place)\nfor <strong>punishment</strong>
    in this context.</p>\n<p>So what of consequences? Well, sometimes punishment is
    a consequence, sometimes\nrunning laps is a consequence, sometimes getting hurt
    from falling out of a\ntree you weren't supposed to be climbing that high in is
    a consequence...\nConsequences are amoral things that happen after something else.
    But\nconsequences presented without a framework for understanding them can sort
    of\nmake them meaningless.</p>\n<p>For a while I would tell my girls that &quot;there
    will be consequences for\ndisobeying&quot;, but this isn't enough - this doesn't
    explain <em>why</em> there are\nconsequenes, it only encoruages obedience to avoid
    <strong>punishment</strong> rather than\nobedience <strong>because it is right</strong>.</p>\n<p>So
    that's a short parenting note that I've been musing on - kids need to grow\nup
    learning how to be disciplined and how to be self-controlled. Raising them\nto
    avoid punishment teaches nothing about the socieatal expectation of\nappropriate
    behavior but rather puts them in a position of just trying to avoid\nsomething
    uncomfortable. That doesn't raise them towards something good, it\nonly teaches
    them to avoid something else.</p>\n<p>If instead my children understand <strong>that
    it is important</strong> to be a disciplined\nhuman, it fosters a relatonship
    of help and love between us. My job isn't to\npunish my kids for misbehaving,
    it's to raise them to be disciplined,\nhonorable, well-meaning people in a society.
    If I'm their teacher and guide\nthen that journey is filled with learning and
    love. If I only arbitrate justice\nthrough negative consequences and punishment,
    then what room is there in their\nhearts to love me as their dad if they're always
    afraid I'm going to punish\nthem for something?</p>\n\n        </section>\n    </article>\n</section>

---

I'm a dad and I have 2 beautiful daughters in my house right now. As they've
grown up just a little from new-born to toddler to child, my wife and I have
worked hard to have the right posture and attitude towards "discipline". I have
noticed that 3 words seem to kind of meld into each other and I prefer they
have clear boundaries, because in our household we're very intentional to not
punish... Punishment is a heavy and weighty thing and we don't want our kids to
grow up thinking they get punished for messing up.

Kids certainly **know** right and wrong to some degree, and even when they
knowingly do something "bad" it's not necessarily that there was malicious
intent behind it... In my mind - 'punishment' is for malpractice, but erroring
and making an unwise choice to "do something bad" is a lack of judgement and
that doesn't require punishment, it should illicit discipline.

Why be so pedantic about these 2 words in particular? Well because I don't
think it's appropriate for my daughters to believe they get punished for
singing at the table... There's nothing morally wrong with that, but we do need
them to focus on meals at meal time, so we practice being disciplined at the
table. If they continue to sing, we utilitze consequences but they are never
penal. What I mean is that if my kids are singing, being loud, etc. at the
table, we have them run laps outside or do jumping jacks. Why? Because getting
that excess energy out is a way for them to discipline their bodies, and learn
to be self-controlled. There's no element of fear or of losing something
because they're struggling to contain themselves while we eat.

!!! note "punishment vs discipline"

    That's the key difference and it's taken several years for me to really drive a
    wedge between "punishment" and "discipline" even in my own worldview as a
    parent. So our language with our kids is "obey the rules or we will do some
    discipline" - never "or you will be punished".

Do you see the difference in how that frames even the obedience and the rule
itself? It's not a thing to follow out of fear, rules are to be followed
**because it's right** and to do what is right requires discipline and
self-control. There is no need (actually there's not even an appropriate place)
for **punishment** in this context.

So what of consequences? Well, sometimes punishment is a consequence, sometimes
running laps is a consequence, sometimes getting hurt from falling out of a
tree you weren't supposed to be climbing that high in is a consequence...
Consequences are amoral things that happen after something else. But
consequences presented without a framework for understanding them can sort of
make them meaningless.

For a while I would tell my girls that "there will be consequences for
disobeying", but this isn't enough - this doesn't explain _why_ there are
consequenes, it only encoruages obedience to avoid **punishment** rather than
obedience **because it is right**.

So that's a short parenting note that I've been musing on - kids need to grow
up learning how to be disciplined and how to be self-controlled. Raising them
to avoid punishment teaches nothing about the socieatal expectation of
appropriate behavior but rather puts them in a position of just trying to avoid
something uncomfortable. That doesn't raise them towards something good, it
only teaches them to avoid something else.

If instead my children understand **that it is important** to be a disciplined
human, it fosters a relatonship of help and love between us. My job isn't to
punish my kids for misbehaving, it's to raise them to be disciplined,
honorable, well-meaning people in a society. If I'm their teacher and guide
then that journey is filled with learning and love. If I only arbitrate justice
through negative consequences and punishment, then what room is there in their
hearts to love me as their dad if they're always afraid I'm going to punish
them for something?
