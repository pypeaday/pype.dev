<p>Here's my thought on <a href="https://homebox.software/en/">💭 HomeBox</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I stumbled onto homebox this morning scrolling a newsletter and it looks like something I've been lightly thinking about for a while. I have wanted a way to track all the things in my house, but I haven't given it enough thought to come up with the specific manner in which to do it. I've seen other asset trackers but today this one excited me.
I spun it up at home quick and it looks great - It'll take quite a lot of time to fill it out but here's a few features I love out of the gate:</p>
<ol>
<li>the default setup seems very useful - pre-populated locations and tags for cataloging assets reduces the barrier to entry for me</li>
<li>it's pretty nice lookin</li>
<li>there's a label generator including qr codes that take you to the record in your homebox... I had an idea for something like this a while ago - qr codes to link to instructions for things around the house (like cleaning the oven or something). So it's neat to see that similar idea played out in another more useful way!</li>
</ol>
