    silo, which is now apart of Cat Digital. The group\nwas called &quot;Information
    Analytics&quot;. As I joined Cat I sort of understood our\nrole to be internal
    consulting. Our group didn't make a product, we were a\nsupport arm. IA (Information
    Analytics) was mostly a SAS shop unfortunately...\nbut fortunately for me I got
    connected very early on, and by nothing other than\ndivine appointment, with 2
    guys who became somewhat like mentors to me. For the\nsake of privacy we'll call
    them Bjorn and Jokko. Jokko is the guy who taught me\ngit (<a class=\"wikilink\"
    href=\"/you-suck-at-git-but-its-honestly-fine\">you-suck-at-git-but-its-honestly-fine</a>),
    and Bjorn is the reason I'm\nworth anything at python.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I
    make comments about it, and have written some, but my career up until very\nrecently
    has been built on python, and if it wasn't for Bjorn or Jokko, as\nwell as others
    who come into the story later, I wouldn't be where I'm at in a\ntechnical sense...
    By God's grace I owe several people a non-trivial debt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As
    I honed by python and git skills amongst a sea of SAS, SQL, and serious lack\nof
    DevOps support I was rotated into a product group, Excavation (EXD) to work\non
    an autonomy-related project. The program I joined in IA was a rotational\nprogram
    so this move was kind of part of the plan - not set in stone, but the\nrotation
    was expected. It also is where I leveled up and entered what I'd\nconsider my
    blue belt phase at Cat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blue-belt\">Blue Belt <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    small. But by God's continued grace on my life Bjorn\njoined the same team literally
    at the same time... We worked together on some\ncool ML stuff. The relevant part
    here is that I did well... This is also about\nwhen I started using Linux, homelabbing,
    and started to bridge the gap in my\nmind between the hardware in my laptop and
    the code I write. I was challenged\nto think about expectations and the axioms
    present in our work. I was hired as\na data scientist but I spent weeks in the
    freezing cold on a Caterpillar 315\nNextGen Hex gathering hydraulics data and
    testing code from the cab. I purchased\nhardware somehow, and carted in by myself
    a massive Deep Learning rig that's\nstill being used last I checked. My boss was
    regularly pleased with the work I\nchose to do and the results. I wasn't often
    given tasks, I was given a\ndescription of a desirable end state, and I worked
    well in that season.</p>\n<p>Due to some restructuring at Caterpillar the EXD
    job morphed into role in ICS\nwhere I worked on Computer Vision projects for safety
    systems. I continued to\ngrow in my skillset here, I was writing ML pipelines
    in horrible ways (I didn't\nknow better), doing stuff in AWS (I knew nothing),
    designing database schemas\nfor projects I didn't understand, consulting on our
    groups NAS hardware (I\nstill believed you could download RAM at this point in
    my life) but in the\nchaos, once again I performed well on my team. This rols
    was the most vague in\nits requirements, and I built my very first platform here
    - a Computer Vision\npipeline that automated indexing new data we got coming in
    from the field,\nrunning computer vision pipelines over various videos with different
    annotation\nformats. It was horrible and thankfully replaced with airflow on k8s
    after I\nleft. But as a one-man team, one-boy team more appropriately, I learned
    a lot\nabout what I will and can do given the right problem.</p>\n<p>But back
    to the moves within the enterprise - from IA to ICS I had little say\nin where
    I went - I might've had some but I felt much more &quot;along for the\nride&quot;.
    And then, in 2021 I made my own choice... I applied for a job in\nRemanufacturing
    as a Sr. Data Scientist after learning about the analytic's\nteam use of a real
    framework for writing pipelines, and the chance to work with\n<a href=\"https://waylonwalker.com\">Waylon</a>...
    I was getting burned out trying to do\neverything myself with little knowledge
    of what or how to do it..</p>\n<p>The data scientist job was a salary grade\nhigher
    and Cat has some odd rules about internal hiring... Deets aside, I was\nallowed
    to take the job. Apart of that move was a desire to move geographically\nbecause
    we were pregnant with our second - so Reman agreed to let me move and\nwork as
    a remote employee - beyond the Covid provisions I was told I could move\nto another
    state and my role would be a remote one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"purple-belt\">Purple Belt

    purple belt status. I grew in my python knowledge,\nand moreso than just python
    for data science, but using python to solve real\nproblems on real computers with
    real networks... It became awesome what I could\nbuild and utilize. But where
    I really gravitated was towards the DevOps\nspace... In all my previous roles,
    there was a serious lack of DevOps and I had\nto always hobble my stuff together
    with bubble gum and tape. But now I was on a\nmore mature data team, and although
    the problem space was more well-defined, we\nwere duplicating tons of effort in
    very inefficient ways. And it's in noticing\nthis and deciding to do something
    about it that I think I really transitioned\ninto a Senior role...</p>\n<p>What
    I did with that observation was build a thing... I started to bring\ntogether
    all our processes that were on the left hand side of writing data\npipelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>central
    config management</li>\n<li>localfirst design (we were logging into the AWS console
    to click buttons in\nthe ever-changing Batch dashboard)</li>\n<li>standard dependencies</li>\n<li>internal
    team interfacing - Cat is huge, you want to deploy something into\nAWS? You better
    know the on-prem networking team and have a security contact\nfor your LTA...</li>\n<li>and
    more...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I took these things under my own management, centralized
    everything that I\nthought made sense, rolled out a cli to the team to make just
    running pipelines\nin AWS a little easier... And from then on I've been working
    on this platform\ncalled <code>rada</code> - Reman Analytics Delivery Acceleration.</p>\n<p>Since
    then I have gotten an &quot;Exceeds Expectations&quot; all 4 years working remote,\nI
    received an award in 2022 called the &quot;CEO Award of Excellence&quot; for the
    work I\nwas doing. My initiatives and vision gave birth to rada - it would not
    exist\nwithout me. Not that the team wouldn't be successful, but through rada
    the\nvelocity of a lean team of data scientists skyrocketed... not only velocity
    but\ncapacity. Rada manages deployments, monitoring, security, updates, etc...
    the\ndata scientists get to wear a &quot;project manager&quot; hat for a little
    while, but\nnow they take it off and move on to another thing, and not babysit
    an\never-growing list of Jupyter notebooks...</p>\n<h2 id=\"betrayed\">Betrayed

    silo, which is now apart of Cat Digital. The group\nwas called &quot;Information
    Analytics&quot;. As I joined Cat I sort of understood our\nrole to be internal
    consulting. Our group didn't make a product, we were a\nsupport arm. IA (Information
    Analytics) was mostly a SAS shop unfortunately...\nbut fortunately for me I got
    connected very early on, and by nothing other than\ndivine appointment, with 2
    guys who became somewhat like mentors to me. For the\nsake of privacy we'll call
    them Bjorn and Jokko. Jokko is the guy who taught me\ngit (<a class=\"wikilink\"
    href=\"/you-suck-at-git-but-its-honestly-fine\">you-suck-at-git-but-its-honestly-fine</a>),
    and Bjorn is the reason I'm\nworth anything at python.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I
    make comments about it, and have written some, but my career up until very\nrecently
    has been built on python, and if it wasn't for Bjorn or Jokko, as\nwell as others
    who come into the story later, I wouldn't be where I'm at in a\ntechnical sense...
    By God's grace I owe several people a non-trivial debt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As
    I honed by python and git skills amongst a sea of SAS, SQL, and serious lack\nof
    DevOps support I was rotated into a product group, Excavation (EXD) to work\non
    an autonomy-related project. The program I joined in IA was a rotational\nprogram
    so this move was kind of part of the plan - not set in stone, but the\nrotation
    was expected. It also is where I leveled up and entered what I'd\nconsider my
    blue belt phase at Cat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blue-belt\">Blue Belt <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    small. But by God's continued grace on my life Bjorn\njoined the same team literally
    at the same time... We worked together on some\ncool ML stuff. The relevant part
    here is that I did well... This is also about\nwhen I started using Linux, homelabbing,
    and started to bridge the gap in my\nmind between the hardware in my laptop and
    the code I write. I was challenged\nto think about expectations and the axioms
    present in our work. I was hired as\na data scientist but I spent weeks in the
    freezing cold on a Caterpillar 315\nNextGen Hex gathering hydraulics data and
    testing code from the cab. I purchased\nhardware somehow, and carted in by myself
    a massive Deep Learning rig that's\nstill being used last I checked. My boss was
    regularly pleased with the work I\nchose to do and the results. I wasn't often
    given tasks, I was given a\ndescription of a desirable end state, and I worked
    well in that season.</p>\n<p>Due to some restructuring at Caterpillar the EXD
    job morphed into role in ICS\nwhere I worked on Computer Vision projects for safety
    systems. I continued to\ngrow in my skillset here, I was writing ML pipelines
    in horrible ways (I didn't\nknow better), doing stuff in AWS (I knew nothing),
    designing database schemas\nfor projects I didn't understand, consulting on our
    groups NAS hardware (I\nstill believed you could download RAM at this point in
    my life) but in the\nchaos, once again I performed well on my team. This rols
    was the most vague in\nits requirements, and I built my very first platform here
    - a Computer Vision\npipeline that automated indexing new data we got coming in
    from the field,\nrunning computer vision pipelines over various videos with different
    annotation\nformats. It was horrible and thankfully replaced with airflow on k8s
    after I\nleft. But as a one-man team, one-boy team more appropriately, I learned
    a lot\nabout what I will and can do given the right problem.</p>\n<p>But back
    to the moves within the enterprise - from IA to ICS I had little say\nin where
    I went - I might've had some but I felt much more &quot;along for the\nride&quot;.
    And then, in 2021 I made my own choice... I applied for a job in\nRemanufacturing
    as a Sr. Data Scientist after learning about the analytic's\nteam use of a real
    framework for writing pipelines, and the chance to work with\n<a href=\"https://waylonwalker.com\">Waylon</a>...
    I was getting burned out trying to do\neverything myself with little knowledge
    of what or how to do it..</p>\n<p>The data scientist job was a salary grade\nhigher
    and Cat has some odd rules about internal hiring... Deets aside, I was\nallowed
    to take the job. Apart of that move was a desire to move geographically\nbecause
    we were pregnant with our second - so Reman agreed to let me move and\nwork as
    a remote employee - beyond the Covid provisions I was told I could move\nto another
    state and my role would be a remote one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"purple-belt\">Purple Belt

    purple belt status. I grew in my python knowledge,\nand moreso than just python
    for data science, but using python to solve real\nproblems on real computers with
    real networks... It became awesome what I could\nbuild and utilize. But where
    I really gravitated was towards the DevOps\nspace... In all my previous roles,
    there was a serious lack of DevOps and I had\nto always hobble my stuff together
    with bubble gum and tape. But now I was on a\nmore mature data team, and although
    the problem space was more well-defined, we\nwere duplicating tons of effort in
    very inefficient ways. And it's in noticing\nthis and deciding to do something
    about it that I think I really transitioned\ninto a Senior role...</p>\n<p>What
    I did with that observation was build a thing... I started to bring\ntogether
    all our processes that were on the left hand side of writing data\npipelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>central
    config management</li>\n<li>localfirst design (we were logging into the AWS console
    to click buttons in\nthe ever-changing Batch dashboard)</li>\n<li>standard dependencies</li>\n<li>internal
    team interfacing - Cat is huge, you want to deploy something into\nAWS? You better
    know the on-prem networking team and have a security contact\nfor your LTA...</li>\n<li>and
    more...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I took these things under my own management, centralized
    everything that I\nthought made sense, rolled out a cli to the team to make just
    running pipelines\nin AWS a little easier... And from then on I've been working
    on this platform\ncalled <code>rada</code> - Reman Analytics Delivery Acceleration.</p>\n<p>Since
    then I have gotten an &quot;Exceeds Expectations&quot; all 4 years working remote,\nI
    received an award in 2022 called the &quot;CEO Award of Excellence&quot; for the
    work I\nwas doing. My initiatives and vision gave birth to rada - it would not
    exist\nwithout me. Not that the team wouldn't be successful, but through rada
    the\nvelocity of a lean team of data scientists skyrocketed... not only velocity
    but\ncapacity. Rada manages deployments, monitoring, security, updates, etc...
    the\ndata scientists get to wear a &quot;project manager&quot; hat for a little
    while, but\nnow they take it off and move on to another thing, and not babysit
    an\never-growing list of Jupyter notebooks...</p>\n<h2 id=\"betrayed\">Betrayed

    silo, which is now apart of Cat Digital. The group\nwas called &quot;Information
    Analytics&quot;. As I joined Cat I sort of understood our\nrole to be internal
    consulting. Our group didn't make a product, we were a\nsupport arm. IA (Information
    Analytics) was mostly a SAS shop unfortunately...\nbut fortunately for me I got
    connected very early on, and by nothing other than\ndivine appointment, with 2
    guys who became somewhat like mentors to me. For the\nsake of privacy we'll call
    them Bjorn and Jokko. Jokko is the guy who taught me\ngit (<a class=\"wikilink\"
    href=\"/you-suck-at-git-but-its-honestly-fine\">you-suck-at-git-but-its-honestly-fine</a>),
    and Bjorn is the reason I'm\nworth anything at python.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I
    make comments about it, and have written some, but my career up until very\nrecently
    has been built on python, and if it wasn't for Bjorn or Jokko, as\nwell as others
    who come into the story later, I wouldn't be where I'm at in a\ntechnical sense...
    By God's grace I owe several people a non-trivial debt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As
    I honed by python and git skills amongst a sea of SAS, SQL, and serious lack\nof
    DevOps support I was rotated into a product group, Excavation (EXD) to work\non
    an autonomy-related project. The program I joined in IA was a rotational\nprogram
    so this move was kind of part of the plan - not set in stone, but the\nrotation
    was expected. It also is where I leveled up and entered what I'd\nconsider my
    blue belt phase at Cat.</p>\n<h2 id=\"blue-belt\">Blue Belt <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    small. But by God's continued grace on my life Bjorn\njoined the same team literally
    at the same time... We worked together on some\ncool ML stuff. The relevant part
    here is that I did well... This is also about\nwhen I started using Linux, homelabbing,
    and started to bridge the gap in my\nmind between the hardware in my laptop and
    the code I write. I was challenged\nto think about expectations and the axioms
    present in our work. I was hired as\na data scientist but I spent weeks in the
    freezing cold on a Caterpillar 315\nNextGen Hex gathering hydraulics data and
    testing code from the cab. I purchased\nhardware somehow, and carted in by myself
    a massive Deep Learning rig that's\nstill being used last I checked. My boss was
    regularly pleased with the work I\nchose to do and the results. I wasn't often
    given tasks, I was given a\ndescription of a desirable end state, and I worked
    well in that season.</p>\n<p>Due to some restructuring at Caterpillar the EXD
    job morphed into role in ICS\nwhere I worked on Computer Vision projects for safety
    systems. I continued to\ngrow in my skillset here, I was writing ML pipelines
    in horrible ways (I didn't\nknow better), doing stuff in AWS (I knew nothing),
    designing database schemas\nfor projects I didn't understand, consulting on our
    groups NAS hardware (I\nstill believed you could download RAM at this point in
    my life) but in the\nchaos, once again I performed well on my team. This rols
    was the most vague in\nits requirements, and I built my very first platform here
    - a Computer Vision\npipeline that automated indexing new data we got coming in
    from the field,\nrunning computer vision pipelines over various videos with different
    annotation\nformats. It was horrible and thankfully replaced with airflow on k8s
    after I\nleft. But as a one-man team, one-boy team more appropriately, I learned
    a lot\nabout what I will and can do given the right problem.</p>\n<p>But back
    to the moves within the enterprise - from IA to ICS I had little say\nin where
    I went - I might've had some but I felt much more &quot;along for the\nride&quot;.
    And then, in 2021 I made my own choice... I applied for a job in\nRemanufacturing
    as a Sr. Data Scientist after learning about the analytic's\nteam use of a real
    framework for writing pipelines, and the chance to work with\n<a href=\"https://waylonwalker.com\">Waylon</a>...
    I was getting burned out trying to do\neverything myself with little knowledge
    of what or how to do it..</p>\n<p>The data scientist job was a salary grade\nhigher
    and Cat has some odd rules about internal hiring... Deets aside, I was\nallowed
    to take the job. Apart of that move was a desire to move geographically\nbecause
    we were pregnant with our second - so Reman agreed to let me move and\nwork as
    a remote employee - beyond the Covid provisions I was told I could move\nto another
    state and my role would be a remote one.</p>\n<h2 id=\"purple-belt\">Purple Belt

    purple belt status. I grew in my python knowledge,\nand moreso than just python
    for data science, but using python to solve real\nproblems on real computers with
    real networks... It became awesome what I could\nbuild and utilize. But where
    I really gravitated was towards the DevOps\nspace... In all my previous roles,
    there was a serious lack of DevOps and I had\nto always hobble my stuff together
    with bubble gum and tape. But now I was on a\nmore mature data team, and although
    the problem space was more well-defined, we\nwere duplicating tons of effort in
    very inefficient ways. And it's in noticing\nthis and deciding to do something
    about it that I think I really transitioned\ninto a Senior role...</p>\n<p>What
    I did with that observation was build a thing... I started to bring\ntogether
    all our processes that were on the left hand side of writing data\npipelines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>central
    config management</li>\n<li>localfirst design (we were logging into the AWS console
    to click buttons in\nthe ever-changing Batch dashboard)</li>\n<li>standard dependencies</li>\n<li>internal
    team interfacing - Cat is huge, you want to deploy something into\nAWS? You better
    know the on-prem networking team and have a security contact\nfor your LTA...</li>\n<li>and
    more...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I took these things under my own management, centralized
    everything that I\nthought made sense, rolled out a cli to the team to make just
    running pipelines\nin AWS a little easier... And from then on I've been working
    on this platform\ncalled <code>rada</code> - Reman Analytics Delivery Acceleration.</p>\n<p>Since
    then I have gotten an &quot;Exceeds Expectations&quot; all 4 years working remote,\nI
    received an award in 2022 called the &quot;CEO Award of Excellence&quot; for the
    work I\nwas doing. My initiatives and vision gave birth to rada - it would not
    exist\nwithout me. Not that the team wouldn't be successful, but through rada
    the\nvelocity of a lean team of data scientists skyrocketed... not only velocity
    but\ncapacity. Rada manages deployments, monitoring, security, updates, etc...
    the\ndata scientists get to wear a &quot;project manager&quot; hat for a little
    while, but\nnow they take it off and move on to another thing, and not babysit
    an\never-growing list of Jupyter notebooks...</p>\n<h2 id=\"betrayed\">Betrayed

    note \"\"\n\n    The title is a tad misleading - I have not **technically** been
    fired... yet...\n\nI work for Caterpillar, Inc. It's a large company, and so during
    my time\nthere I was able to work in 4 different divisions...\n\n!!! note \"TLDR\"\n\n
    \   This may be a longer post, but I wrote up the highlights [TLDR](#tldr)\n\n##
    White Belt\n\nI started in an Analytics silo, which is now apart of Cat Digital.
    The group\nwas called \"Information Analytics\". As I joined Cat I sort of understood
    our\nrole to be internal consulting. Our group didn't make a product, we were
    a\nsupport arm. IA (Information Analytics) was mostly a SAS shop unfortunately...\nbut
    fortunately for me I got connected very early on, and by nothing other than\ndivine
    appointment, with 2 guys who became somewhat like mentors to me. For the\nsake
    of privacy we'll call them Bjorn and Jokko. Jokko is the guy who taught me\ngit
    ([[you-suck-at-git-but-its-honestly-fine]]), and Bjorn is the reason I'm\nworth
    anything at python.\n\n> I make comments about it, and have written some, but
    my career up until very\n> recently has been built on python, and if it wasn't
    for Bjorn or Jokko, as\n> well as others who come into the story later, I wouldn't
    be where I'm at in a\n> technical sense... By God's grace I owe several people
    a non-trivial debt.\n\nAs I honed by python and git skills amongst a sea of SAS,
    SQL, and serious lack\nof DevOps support I was rotated into a product group, Excavation
    (EXD) to work\non an autonomy-related project. The program I joined in IA was
    a rotational\nprogram so this move was kind of part of the plan - not set in stone,
    but the\nrotation was expected. It also is where I leveled up and entered what
    I'd\nconsider my blue belt phase at Cat.\n\n## Blue Belt\n\nThe team I joined
    was small. But by God's continued grace on my life Bjorn\njoined the same team
    literally at the same time... We worked together on some\ncool ML stuff. The relevant
    part here is that I did well... This is also about\nwhen I started using Linux,
    homelabbing, and started to bridge the gap in my\nmind between the hardware in
    my laptop and the code I write. I was challenged\nto think about expectations
    and the axioms present in our work. I was hired as\na data scientist but I spent
    weeks in the freezing cold on a Caterpillar 315\nNextGen Hex gathering hydraulics
    data and testing code from the cab. I purchased\nhardware somehow, and carted
    in by myself a massive Deep Learning rig that's\nstill being used last I checked.
    My boss was regularly pleased with the work I\nchose to do and the results. I
    wasn't often given tasks, I was given a\ndescription of a desirable end state,
    and I worked well in that season.\n\nDue to some restructuring at Caterpillar
    the EXD job morphed into role in ICS\nwhere I worked on Computer Vision projects
    for safety systems. I continued to\ngrow in my skillset here, I was writing ML
    pipelines in horrible ways (I didn't\nknow better), doing stuff in AWS (I knew
    nothing), designing database schemas\nfor projects I didn't understand, consulting
    on our groups NAS hardware (I\nstill believed you could download RAM at this point
    in my life) but in the\nchaos, once again I performed well on my team. This rols
    was the most vague in\nits requirements, and I built my very first platform here
    - a Computer Vision\npipeline that automated indexing new data we got coming in
    from the field,\nrunning computer vision pipelines over various videos with different
    annotation\nformats. It was horrible and thankfully replaced with airflow on k8s
    after I\nleft. But as a one-man team, one-boy team more appropriately, I learned
    a lot\nabout what I will and can do given the right problem.\n\nBut back to the
    moves within the enterprise - from IA to ICS I had little say\nin where I went
    - I might've had some but I felt much more \"along for the\nride\". And then,
    in 2021 I made my own choice... I applied for a job in\nRemanufacturing as a Sr.
    Data Scientist after learning about the analytic's\nteam use of a real framework
    for writing pipelines, and the chance to work with\n[Waylon](https://waylonwalker.com)...
    I was getting burned out trying to do\neverything myself with little knowledge
    of what or how to do it..\n\nThe data scientist job was a salary grade\nhigher
    and Cat has some odd rules about internal hiring... Deets aside, I was\nallowed
    to take the job. Apart of that move was a desire to move geographically\nbecause
    we were pregnant with our second - so Reman agreed to let me move and\nwork as
    a remote employee - beyond the Covid provisions I was told I could move\nto another
    state and my role would be a remote one.\n\n## Purple Belt\n\nIn Reman I'd say
    I earned purple belt status. I grew in my python knowledge,\nand moreso than just
    python for data science, but using python to solve real\nproblems on real computers
    with real networks... It became awesome what I could\nbuild and utilize. But where
    I really gravitated was towards the DevOps\nspace... In all my previous roles,
    there was a serious lack of DevOps and I had\nto always hobble my stuff together
    with bubble gum and tape. But now I was on a\nmore mature data team, and although
    the problem space was more well-defined, we\nwere duplicating tons of effort in
    very inefficient ways. And it's in noticing\nthis and deciding to do something
    about it that I think I really transitioned\ninto a Senior role...\n\nWhat I did
    with that observation was build a thing... I started to bring\ntogether all our
    processes that were on the left hand side of writing data\npipelines:\n\n- central
    config management\n- localfirst design (we were logging into the AWS console to
    click buttons in\nthe ever-changing Batch dashboard)\n- standard dependencies\n-
    internal team interfacing - Cat is huge, you want to deploy something into\nAWS?
    You better know the on-prem networking team and have a security contact\nfor your
    LTA...\n- and more...\n\nI took these things under my own management, centralized
    everything that I\nthought made sense, rolled out a cli to the team to make just
    running pipelines\nin AWS a little easier... And from then on I've been working
    on this platform\ncalled `rada` - Reman Analytics Delivery Acceleration.\n\nSince
    then I have gotten an \"Exceeds Expectations\" all 4 years working remote,\nI
    received an award in 2022 called the \"CEO Award of Excellence\" for the work
    I\nwas doing. My initiatives and vision gave birth to rada - it would not exist\nwithout
    me. Not that the team wouldn't be successful, but through rada the\nvelocity of
    a lean team of data scientists skyrocketed... not only velocity but\ncapacity.
    Rada manages deployments, monitoring, security, updates, etc... the\ndata scientists
    get to wear a \"project manager\" hat for a little while, but\nnow they take it
    off and move on to another thing, and not babysit an\never-growing list of Jupyter
    notebooks...\n\n## Betrayed\n\nAnd then I was recently informed that Caterpillar
    has determined that my role is\nan \"in office\" role that would be be performed
    best amongst the physical crowd\nof workers at a giant facility in the middle
    of nowhere. So I was given a\nchoice - uproot the life I was told I could leave
    to create, or be fired... To\nbe frank I was actually expecting a promotion this
    year...\n\nJust like that Cat decided that the platform I conceived, the value
    I created,\ntheir word to me about working remote, 4 years of exceeding expectations
    in\nofficial end of year reviews.... after all of that, my job wasn't worth doing\nremotely
    anymore, to the degree that they'll fire me over it\n\n## Fin\n\nI was greatly
    looking forward to leveling up, the DevOps Brown Belt and Principal Black\nBelt
    were absolutely in my sights but not for the sake of the title - I\ngenuinely
    believe in the platform I built. It was my art and unfortunately it\nlooks like
    I'll be practicing the discipline of platform engineering somewhere\nelse, in
    a system designed by someone else, solving problems I never had...\nSomewhere
    that I didn't pour myself into, something I don't own.\n\n??? warning \"I expect
    clarity on our decision to come in Summer of 2026...\"\n\n\n## TLDR\n\n???+ danger
    \"You gave me a great start but from the bottom of my heart - Fuck you, Caterpillar\"\n\n[back
