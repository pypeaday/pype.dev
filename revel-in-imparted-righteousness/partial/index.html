            <p>Spurgeon's Morning and Evening today is from Jeremiah 23:6.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p>Again with these reflections, I&quot;m not an OT scholar and I don't know, or
didn't do a lot of search on, the context of the passage. This isn't
educational, this if a reflection on what God brings to mind through his Word
and my time with him, not teaching about the historical context of where the
words in Jeremiah 23 actually affect the story</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Jeremiah 23:6</p>
<p>In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely. And this
is the name by which he will be called: ‘The Lord is our righteousness.’</p>

<p>There's a lot of tension in the details of the story of the world in how humans
and God relate to each other. On one hand, God created everything, and he
created humans with a unique purpose to be his seen-imagers in the physical
world who carry out his will. On the other hand, humans take that position of
privilege and often destroy the world in our sin and dismay. The theology
surrounding this tension is the thing that can affect the Christian's daily
life... As I walk through the world, am I more aware of my position as God's
child, with responsibility to bear his Name and steward the earth, or am I more
aware of my sin and the fact that I often make choices Jesus wouldn't be proud
of? Both things are true, but where I put my mind and heart drives if I have a
contented smile on my face or if my brow is sweaty and scunched up in
frustration.</p>
<p>I think that if we somehow filtered our view to all &quot;true Christians&quot; we'd see
that a majority of them lean in on emphasizing their sin because it is the
thing that makes Jesus' work necessary - it is the un-overcomable thing that we
have to be saved from and Glory to God! for saving us. But on the daily, not
putting equal emphasis on the next step of the story, which is that in God's
saving he imparts the righteousness of Jesus right onto us, is a disservice to
us as God's children.</p>
<p>I want my kids to be proud and secure in their name and place as my kids. I
don't want them to spend their energy focusing on where they have contributed
chaos and disorder to my life, I want them to focus on the things they do worth
being proud of, and there's grace for the rest. I think this must be true of
the Lord as well - without a doubt I am a sinner and a wretch who, left to my
own devices, would end up a drunken addict lying in the street somewhere... but
why would I <strong>focus</strong> on that when Yahweh chooses me, imparts Jesus'
righteousness to me, adopts me as his own! The reality of my sin is reality,
but the reality of Jesus' grace on my life is no less true. Christians
shouldn't be ignorant of the sin they carry and the choices they make which
dishonor God, but we also shouldn't be ignorant of the grace God shows to us!</p>
<p>I have noticed in my life, as the scales have tipped somewhat in favor of
focusing <strong>more</strong> on Yahweh adopting me as opposed to focusing on where I fall
short of the glory of God, that's it's more natural for me to be joyful about
almost anything in the world (worth experiencing joy over)</p>
<p>May Jesus call you today if you're reading this and he hasnt' yet, and if he
has may joy follow your acknowledgement of your adoption rather than sorrow
over your previous state. Glory to God in the highest!</p>
