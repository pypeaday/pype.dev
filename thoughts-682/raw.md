Here's my thought on <a href="https://typ.ing/stats/daily-challenge">ðŸ’­ daily challenge leaderboard | typ.ing</a>

---

typ.ing is like monkeytype to a degree. it's made by ZSA, who makes my keyboard, and I love the idea of a simple training tool for getting fluent with my board and keymaps. The daily challenge is a nice little way to earn some internet points, and although I missed a day recently I want to stay consistent with it each morning... someday I'll hit 130 99% accuracy
