<p>We returned to Gurnee in June of 2025 (so a summer trip) and had a great time.</p>
<p>We experienced the bigger slides on this grip - and they were a blast. We had
our oldest sneakly get up on her toes when the door guard measured her height
and we got her JUST up to 48&quot; for the GREEN bracelet which got us on the double
whirlwind amongst other super fun slides.</p>
<p>This trip I also got the idea for the <a class="wikilink" href="/gwl-margarita-tracker">gwl-margarita-tracker</a>!</p>

<p>If you buy the wand or a topper it seems like that includes a &quot;session&quot; of
the game. We brought our wands and toppers this time, and when we went to play
the game said our time expired... Turns out you have to pay $15 for another
session of playing even if you already bought all the gear!</p>

<li>I brought my lulu shirts but the wristband snags them and my sweatshirts like
crazy - bring athletic hoodies and regular cotton t-shirts to avoid the snag</li>

take a quick hike for a butter burger</li>

<p>We decided to try to save some money on food on this trip, but we had to be
careful... there's no condos so we were in a regular resort room. We brought
pulled pork and a crock pot which worked great. You get a mini fridge, so lunch
meats and cheeses made for easy sandwiches. There's an ice machine in the
hallway if you want to keep anything on ice... We also brough a griddle,
thinking we could cook up some eggs or something - and it might've worked but
the griddle was BRAND NEW so we got some smoke and didn't want to risk
anything... we will certainly break it in and try it on the next trip so stay
tuned...</p>

<p>After experiencing the Gurnee location we were excited to checkout the Dells as well.</p>
<p>The waterpark is organized a little differently - and the only real
observations are that the wave pool is a lot bigger than Gurnee's but the lazy
river is a lot smaller...</p>
<p>We stayed in a condo during this trip, which was great with a kitchenette -
buying groceries and just doing sandwiches or pasta for meals saved a boat load
of money, probably enough to nearly off-set the cost of the condo over a
regular room.</p>
<p>At this location the Magiquest setup is unique - it's in its own building,
which is setup as like a 4 story high jungle gym. It's very cool, and the kids
can run around to play the magiquest game, or ditch the wands and just run
around and slide down slides and stuff... our kids had a blast at 3 and 5 years
old.</p>

<p>We went to GWL in Gurnee in 2023 for the first time, and we didn't know exactly
what to expect. We are also are not very experienced travelers, so packing for
a trip (particularly in the food department) is tough... which isn't a huge
deal - it just means we spent a LOT on food at the resort...</p>
<p>For this trip our kids were 2 and 4 and it was still a valuable trip. The
waterpark is organized in such a way that the littler kids have their own space
away from the bigger ones, it's very safe, and the slides and stuff even for
the littles are great.</p>
<p>I'm writing this in July after our 3rd trip, so I don't have all the memories
from this first one, but here's a short list of things if traveling with kids
say younger than 5:</p>
<ol>
<li>water shoes would be a good purchase for the kids if they're going to be in the littles area. The ground there for some reason is murder on the feet (on a future visit we realzied the rest of the waterpark's ground isn't so bad... not sure why the kiddo's pool was so rough)</li>
<li>you don't need to bring towels</li>
<li>you don't need nearly as many clothes as you think, just underwear and enough swimming gear... no one is dressed in much more than swimwear and a cover-up like a t-shirt even at the restaurants pretty much</li>
</ol>
