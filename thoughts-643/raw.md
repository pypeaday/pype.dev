Here's my thought on <a href="https://docs.openwebui.com/tutorials/web-search/searxng/">ðŸ’­ SearXNG | Open WebUI</a>

I've been meaning to set searxng for a while - it comes out of the box with khoj but I want an instance for open-webui as I get serious about deciding on a self-hosted AI tool-chain solution. It look like the setup for open-webui is a touch more than "docker compose up" so it'll take probably 15-20 minutes of dedicated time to try this out
