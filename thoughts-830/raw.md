Here's my thought on <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/engineering-excellence-starts-on-edge-c36e4c59">ðŸ’­ Engineering excellence starts on edge</a>

---

I have become a huge DHH fan, maybe that means I'm just a basic bish but as I've become aware of who he has I haven't yet disagreed with much that he has to say... And fortunately or unfortuntaely that remanins true with this post about getting involved "at the edge". 

I feel like I bounce between "give me bleeding edge" and "give me unshakable stability" on the daily, and there's probably a time and place for both... I think I am prone to take on initial viewpoints and so I don't want to abandon my desire for stability, but man... maybe running Arch wouldn't be that bad, maybe a release-candidate container for an app at home here or there would be an interesting way to give back even a fraction to the FOSS community.

I try to open issues on GH and such when things happen, but I could take a more proactive approach especially with the software that I use more regularly...

Thanks DHH for posting these thoughts, keep em coming!
