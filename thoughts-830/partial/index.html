<p>Here's my thought on <a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/engineering-excellence-starts-on-edge-c36e4c59">💭 Engineering excellence starts on edge</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I have become a huge DHH fan, maybe that means I'm just a basic bish but as I've become aware of who he has I haven't yet disagreed with much that he has to say... And fortunately or unfortuntaely that remanins true with this post about getting involved &quot;at the edge&quot;.</p>
<p>I feel like I bounce between &quot;give me bleeding edge&quot; and &quot;give me unshakable stability&quot; on the daily, and there's probably a time and place for both... I think I am prone to take on initial viewpoints and so I don't want to abandon my desire for stability, but man... maybe running Arch wouldn't be that bad, maybe a release-candidate container for an app at home here or there would be an interesting way to give back even a fraction to the FOSS community.</p>
<p>I try to open issues on GH and such when things happen, but I could take a more proactive approach especially with the software that I use more regularly...</p>
<p>Thanks DHH for posting these thoughts, keep em coming!</p>
