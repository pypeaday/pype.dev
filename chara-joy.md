  Joy\n\nThere are several words for similar feelings - example like `joy` has several
  synonyms.\n\n## Sources\n\nGenesis tells us creation and life bring joy\nPsalm 104
  - A good bottle of wine is God's gift to bring joy to people's hearts\nP#lm 65 -
  Beautiful things bring joy\nJeremiah 33:11 - Weddings\n\n## Corruption\n\nBible
  shows us that humanity and brokenness mark our world by death and loss\n\n## Joy
  in spite of corruption\n\nGod's people have reasons in God's faithfulness to be
  joyful. \nJoy in the LORD is not determinmed by current struggles, but by future
  hope and deliverance\n\n## Jesus\n\nHis birth gives good news and brings great joy\n\nMatthew
  5 - Jesus says to rejoice and be glad when we are persecuted for his Name\n\n##
  Apostles\n\nPaul says he chooses joy when he is in jail\n\n!!! note \"\"\n\n    Joy
  is a _choice_\n\n2 Corinthians 6:10 -> Paul is filled with sorrow and yet rejoicing\n\n!!!
  success \"\"\n\n    Christian joy is rooted in future hope and expectation of a
  Messiah, of\n    Jesus, to come again. It is a profound choice, not the result of
  current\n    circumstances\n\n# Questions\n\n!!! note \"1\"\n\n    The Israelites
  choose a path apart from God. As a result, they get exiled\n    from their land
  and dominated by foreign nations. But the prophet Isaiah\n    knew that sorrow would
  not have the final word with these people. He looked\n    forward to the day when
  Yahweh would end pain and corruption to lead them\n    into endless, joyful living.
  Read Isaiah 49:13 and Isaiah 51:11 . What does\n    Isaiah tell us about God\u2019s
  character in these passages? What does Isaiah\n    say will happen to God\u2019s
  people?\n\n!!! scripture \"Isaiah 49:13\"\n\n    \n\n    13Shout for joy, O heavens!
  And rejoice, O earth!\n\n    Break forth into joyful shouting, O mountains!\n\n
  \   For the Lord has comforted His people\n\n    And will have compassion on His
  afflicted.\n\n!!! scripture \"Isaiah 51:11\"\n\n    11So the ransomed of the Lord
  will return\n\n    And come with joyful shouting to Zion,\n\n    And everlasting
  joy will be on their heads.\n\n    They will obtain gladness and joy,\n\n    And
  sorrow and sighing will flee away.\n\nIsiah tells us that God is good and faithful.
  He mentions God's past\nfaithfulness - `For the Lord _has_ comforted His people`
  as well as future\nfaithfulness - `So the randomed of the Lord _will_ return...`\n\nIsiah
  leans in on Yahweh's defining nature from Exodus 34:6. God's `hesed`, his\n**steadfase
  love**, is what is our hope. Otherwise our God is no different than\nany powerful
  but fickle diety. \n\nIsiah also doesn't, in these short passages, promise or claim
  a promise of any\nkind of temporal happiness - the joy is historical-facing in reflecting
  on\nGod's deliverance and future-facing inr reflecting also on God's deliverance.\nGod's
  people were still supposed to find this joy in the midst of their bondage.\n\n\n!!!
  note \"2\"\n\n    The prophet Isaiah looked forward to the coming of Israel\u2019s
  redeemer. His\n    prophecies were fulfilled with the arrival of Jesus. Read Luke
  2:9-11 . Why\n    were the shepherds afraid? What reasons did the angels give for
  them to\n    rejoice instead?\n\n!!! scripture \"Luke 2:9-11\"\n\n    9And an angel
  of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the\n    Lord shone around
  them; and they were terribly frightened. 10But the angel\n    said to them, \u201CDo
  not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great\n    joy which will be
  for all the people; 11for today in the city of David\n    there has been born for
  you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.\n\nPresumably the shepherds were afraid because
  of `the glory of the Lord`. All\nthroughout the OT we have examples of God's people
  fearing this glory,\nspecifically on Sinai. Yahweh even tells Moses that he can
  only be shown\nYahweh's back due to his glory, and then Moses has to veil his face
  so that the\nglory of the Lord persisted on him would not terrify the Israelites.\n\nThe
  angels outright said that a Savior has been born, the Messiah has come.\nThere is
  no greater cause for joy than the king of creation returning\n\n!!! note \"3\"\n\n
  \   Joy can persist in the harshest of circumstances because it depends on God\n
  \   and his promises. Read Matthew 5:11-12 , Acts 13:50-52 , and Hebrews 12:1-3\n
  \   . According to these passages, what specific truths about God can sustain\n
  \   joy even through painful or dire situations?\n\n!!! success \"\"\n\n    Joy
  can persist in the harshest of circumstances because it depends on God\n    and
  his promises.\n\n\n!!! scripture \"Matthew 5:11-12\"\n\n    11\u201CBlessed are
  you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely\n    say all kinds of
  evil against you because of Me. 12Rejoice and be glad, for\n    your reward in heaven
  is great; for in the same way they persecuted the\n    prophets who were before
  you.\n\n!!! scripture \"Acts 13:50-52\"\n\n    50But the Jews incited the devout
  women of prominence and the leading men\n    of the city, and instigated a persecution
  against Paul and Barnabas, and\n    drove them out of their district. 51But they
  shook off the dust of their\n    feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.
  52And the disciples were\n    continually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.\n\n\n!!!
  scripture \"Hebrews 12:1-3\"\n\n    Jesus, the Example\n\n    1Therefore, since
  we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let\n    us also lay aside
  every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles\n    us, and let us run
  with endurance the race that is set before us, 2fixing\n    our eyes on Jesus, the
  author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set\n    before Him endured the cross,
  despising the shame, and has sat down at the\n    right hand of the throne of God.
  3For consider Him who has endured such\n    hostility by sinners against Himself,
  so that you will not grow weary and\n    lose heart.\n\n1. Harsh treatment of us,
  particularly for faith, reflects Jesus' life. We stand\nwith God-incarnate in living
  for a different kingdom which has negative\nconsequences for us in the modern age,
  but obviously not in God's age that's\nalready here and yet coming.\n\n2. Holy Spirit
  gives us joy\n\n3. We have long list of people in history who lived faithful lives,
  struggled\n   with God, experienced pain, and yet were faithful the Lord by God's
  own\n   grace. Similarly we are chosen and favored - the receipients of God's\n
  \  `hesed` love.\n\n4. \n\n\n!!! note \"4\"\n\n    When we see how Jesus\u2019 loving
  way of life has overcome death itself, joy\n    starts to become strangely reasonable.
  But this doesn\u2019t mean it is wise to\n    ignore or suppress sorrow. Read 2
  Corinthians 6:3-10 . How did Paul\n    integrate both joy and sorrow?\n\n!!! scripture
  \"2 Corinthians 6:3-10\"\n\n    3giving no cause for offense in anything, so that
  the ministry will not be\n    discredited, 4but in everything commending ourselves
  as servants of God, in\n    much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses,
  5in beatings,\n    in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in
  hunger, 6in\n    purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit,
  in\n    genuine love, 7in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the weapons
  of\n    righteousness for the right hand and the left, 8by glory and dishonor, by\n
  \   evil report and good report; regarded as deceivers and yet true; 9as\n    unknown
  yet well-known, as dying yet behold, we live; as punished yet not\n    put to death,
  10as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many\n    rich, as having
  nothing yet possessing all things."

    note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">1</p>\n<p>The Israelites choose a path
    apart from God. As a result, they get exiled\nfrom their land and dominated by
    foreign nations. But the prophet Isaiah\nknew that sorrow would not have the final
    word with these people. He looked\nforward to the day when Yahweh would end pain
    and corruption to lead them\ninto endless, joyful living. Read Isaiah 49:13 and
    Isaiah 51:11 . What does\nIsaiah tell us about God\u2019s character in these passages?
    What does Isaiah\nsay will happen to God\u2019s people?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition
    scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Isaiah 49:13</p>\n<p>13Shout for joy,
    O heavens! And rejoice, O earth!</p>\n<p>Break forth into joyful shouting, O mountains!</p>\n<p>For
    the Lord has comforted His people</p>\n<p>And will have compassion on His afflicted.</p>\n</div>\n<div
    class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Isaiah 51:11</p>\n<p>11So
    the ransomed of the Lord will return</p>\n<p>And come with joyful shouting to
    Zion,</p>\n<p>And everlasting joy will be on their heads.</p>\n<p>They will obtain
    gladness and joy,</p>\n<p>And sorrow and sighing will flee away.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Isiah
    tells us that God is good and faithful. He mentions God's past\nfaithfulness -
    <code>For the Lord _has_ comforted His people</code> as well as future\nfaithfulness
    - <code>So the randomed of the Lord _will_ return...</code></p>\n<p>Isiah leans
    in on Yahweh's defining nature from Exodus 34:6. God's <code>hesed</code>, his\n<strong>steadfase
    love</strong>, is what is our hope. Otherwise our God is no different than\nany
    powerful but fickle diety.</p>\n<p>Isiah also doesn't, in these short passages,
    promise or claim a promise of any\nkind of temporal happiness - the joy is historical-facing
    in reflecting on\nGod's deliverance and future-facing inr reflecting also on God's
    deliverance.\nGod's people were still supposed to find this joy in the midst of
    their bondage.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">2</p>\n<p>The
    prophet Isaiah looked forward to the coming of Israel\u2019s redeemer. His\nprophecies
    were fulfilled with the arrival of Jesus. Read Luke 2:9-11 . Why\nwere the shepherds
    afraid? What reasons did the angels give for them to\nrejoice instead?</p>\n</div>\n<div
    class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Luke 2:9-11</p>\n<p>9And
    an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the\nLord shone
    around them; and they were terribly frightened. 10But the angel\nsaid to them,
    \u201CDo not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great\njoy which
    will be for all the people; 11for today in the city of David\nthere has been born
    for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Presumably the shepherds
    were afraid because of <code>the glory of the Lord</code>. All\nthroughout the
    OT we have examples of God's people fearing this glory,\nspecifically on Sinai.
    Yahweh even tells Moses that he can only be shown\nYahweh's back due to his glory,
    and then Moses has to veil his face so that the\nglory of the Lord persisted on
    him would not terrify the Israelites.</p>\n<p>The angels outright said that a
    Savior has been born, the Messiah has come.\nThere is no greater cause for joy
    than the king of creation returning</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">3</p>\n<p>Joy
    can persist in the harshest of circumstances because it depends on God\nand his
    promises. Read Matthew 5:11-12 , Acts 13:50-52 , and Hebrews 12:1-3\n. According
    to these passages, what specific truths about God can sustain\njoy even through
    painful or dire situations?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition success\">\n<p>Joy
    can persist in the harshest of circumstances because it depends on God\nand his
    promises.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Matthew
    5:11-12</p>\n<p>11\u201CBlessed are you when people insult you and persecute you,
    and falsely\nsay all kinds of evil against you because of Me. 12Rejoice and be
    glad, for\nyour reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted
    the\nprophets who were before you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Acts 13:50-52</p>\n<p>50But the Jews incited the devout
    women of prominence and the leading men\nof the city, and instigated a persecution
    against Paul and Barnabas, and\ndrove them out of their district. 51But they shook
    off the dust of their\nfeet in protest against them and went to Iconium. 52And
    the disciples were\ncontinually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</p>\n</div>\n<div
    class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Hebrews 12:1-3</p>\n<p>Jesus,
    the Example</p>\n<p>1Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding
    us, let\nus also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles\nus,
    and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2fixing\nour eyes
    on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set\nbefore Him endured
    the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the\nright hand of the throne
    of God. 3For consider Him who has endured such\nhostility by sinners against Himself,
    so that you will not grow weary and\nlose heart.</p>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Harsh
    treatment of us, particularly for faith, reflects Jesus' life. We stand\nwith
    God-incarnate in living for a different kingdom which has negative\nconsequences
    for us in the modern age, but obviously not in God's age that's\nalready here
    and yet coming.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Holy Spirit gives us joy</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We
    have long list of people in history who lived faithful lives, struggled\nwith
    God, experienced pain, and yet were faithful the Lord by God's own\ngrace. Similarly
    we are chosen and favored - the receipients of God's\n<code>hesed</code> love.</p>\n</li>\n<li></li>\n</ol>\n<div
    class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">4</p>\n<p>When we see
    how Jesus\u2019 loving way of life has overcome death itself, joy\nstarts to become
    strangely reasonable. But this doesn\u2019t mean it is wise to\nignore or suppress
    sorrow. Read 2 Corinthians 6:3-10 . How did Paul\nintegrate both joy and sorrow?</p>\n</div>\n<div
    class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">2 Corinthians 6:3-10</p>\n<p>3giving
    no cause for offense in anything, so that the ministry will not be\ndiscredited,
    4but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God, in\nmuch endurance,
    in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses, 5in beatings,\nin imprisonments,
    in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hunger, 6in\npurity, in knowledge,
    in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in\ngenuine love, 7in the word of
    truth, in the power of God; by the weapons of\nrighteousness for the right hand
    and the left, 8by glory and dishonor, by\nevil report and good report; regarded
    as deceivers and yet true; 9as\nunknown yet well-known, as dying yet behold, we
    live; as punished yet not\nput to death, 10as sorrowful yet always rejoicing,
    as poor yet making many\nrich, as having nothing yet possessing all things.</p>\n</div>\n\n

    note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">1</p>\n<p>The Israelites choose a path
    apart from God. As a result, they get exiled\nfrom their land and dominated by
    foreign nations. But the prophet Isaiah\nknew that sorrow would not have the final
    word with these people. He looked\nforward to the day when Yahweh would end pain
    and corruption to lead them\ninto endless, joyful living. Read Isaiah 49:13 and
    Isaiah 51:11 . What does\nIsaiah tell us about God\u2019s character in these passages?
    What does Isaiah\nsay will happen to God\u2019s people?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition
    scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Isaiah 49:13</p>\n<p>13Shout for joy,
    O heavens! And rejoice, O earth!</p>\n<p>Break forth into joyful shouting, O mountains!</p>\n<p>For
    the Lord has comforted His people</p>\n<p>And will have compassion on His afflicted.</p>\n</div>\n<div
    class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Isaiah 51:11</p>\n<p>11So
    the ransomed of the Lord will return</p>\n<p>And come with joyful shouting to
    Zion,</p>\n<p>And everlasting joy will be on their heads.</p>\n<p>They will obtain
    gladness and joy,</p>\n<p>And sorrow and sighing will flee away.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Isiah
    tells us that God is good and faithful. He mentions God's past\nfaithfulness -
    <code>For the Lord _has_ comforted His people</code> as well as future\nfaithfulness
    - <code>So the randomed of the Lord _will_ return...</code></p>\n<p>Isiah leans
    in on Yahweh's defining nature from Exodus 34:6. God's <code>hesed</code>, his\n<strong>steadfase
    love</strong>, is what is our hope. Otherwise our God is no different than\nany
    powerful but fickle diety.</p>\n<p>Isiah also doesn't, in these short passages,
    promise or claim a promise of any\nkind of temporal happiness - the joy is historical-facing
    in reflecting on\nGod's deliverance and future-facing inr reflecting also on God's
    deliverance.\nGod's people were still supposed to find this joy in the midst of
    their bondage.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">2</p>\n<p>The
    prophet Isaiah looked forward to the coming of Israel\u2019s redeemer. His\nprophecies
    were fulfilled with the arrival of Jesus. Read Luke 2:9-11 . Why\nwere the shepherds
    afraid? What reasons did the angels give for them to\nrejoice instead?</p>\n</div>\n<div
    class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Luke 2:9-11</p>\n<p>9And
    an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the\nLord shone
    around them; and they were terribly frightened. 10But the angel\nsaid to them,
    \u201CDo not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great\njoy which
    will be for all the people; 11for today in the city of David\nthere has been born
    for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Presumably the shepherds
    were afraid because of <code>the glory of the Lord</code>. All\nthroughout the
    OT we have examples of God's people fearing this glory,\nspecifically on Sinai.
    Yahweh even tells Moses that he can only be shown\nYahweh's back due to his glory,
    and then Moses has to veil his face so that the\nglory of the Lord persisted on
    him would not terrify the Israelites.</p>\n<p>The angels outright said that a
    Savior has been born, the Messiah has come.\nThere is no greater cause for joy
    than the king of creation returning</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">3</p>\n<p>Joy
    can persist in the harshest of circumstances because it depends on God\nand his
    promises. Read Matthew 5:11-12 , Acts 13:50-52 , and Hebrews 12:1-3\n. According
    to these passages, what specific truths about God can sustain\njoy even through
    painful or dire situations?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition success\">\n<p>Joy
    can persist in the harshest of circumstances because it depends on God\nand his
    promises.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Matthew
    5:11-12</p>\n<p>11\u201CBlessed are you when people insult you and persecute you,
    and falsely\nsay all kinds of evil against you because of Me. 12Rejoice and be
    glad, for\nyour reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted
    the\nprophets who were before you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Acts 13:50-52</p>\n<p>50But the Jews incited the devout
    women of prominence and the leading men\nof the city, and instigated a persecution
    against Paul and Barnabas, and\ndrove them out of their district. 51But they shook
    off the dust of their\nfeet in protest against them and went to Iconium. 52And
    the disciples were\ncontinually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</p>\n</div>\n<div
    class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Hebrews 12:1-3</p>\n<p>Jesus,
    the Example</p>\n<p>1Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding
    us, let\nus also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles\nus,
    and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2fixing\nour eyes
    on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set\nbefore Him endured
    the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the\nright hand of the throne
    of God. 3For consider Him who has endured such\nhostility by sinners against Himself,
    so that you will not grow weary and\nlose heart.</p>\n</div>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Harsh
    treatment of us, particularly for faith, reflects Jesus' life. We stand\nwith
    God-incarnate in living for a different kingdom which has negative\nconsequences
    for us in the modern age, but obviously not in God's age that's\nalready here
    and yet coming.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Holy Spirit gives us joy</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We
    have long list of people in history who lived faithful lives, struggled\nwith
    God, experienced pain, and yet were faithful the Lord by God's own\ngrace. Similarly
    we are chosen and favored - the receipients of God's\n<code>hesed</code> love.</p>\n</li>\n<li></li>\n</ol>\n<div
    class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">4</p>\n<p>When we see
    how Jesus\u2019 loving way of life has overcome death itself, joy\nstarts to become
    strangely reasonable. But this doesn\u2019t mean it is wise to\nignore or suppress
    sorrow. Read 2 Corinthians 6:3-10 . How did Paul\nintegrate both joy and sorrow?</p>\n</div>\n<div
    class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">2 Corinthians 6:3-10</p>\n<p>3giving
    no cause for offense in anything, so that the ministry will not be\ndiscredited,
    4but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God, in\nmuch endurance,
    in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses, 5in beatings,\nin imprisonments,
    in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hunger, 6in\npurity, in knowledge,
    in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in\ngenuine love, 7in the word of
    truth, in the power of God; by the weapons of\nrighteousness for the right hand
    and the left, 8by glory and dishonor, by\nevil report and good report; regarded
    as deceivers and yet true; 9as\nunknown yet well-known, as dying yet behold, we
    live; as punished yet not\nput to death, 10as sorrowful yet always rejoicing,
    as poor yet making many\nrich, as having nothing yet possessing all things.</p>\n</div>\n\n

!!! note ""

    Joy is a _choice_

2 Corinthians 6:10 -> Paul is filled with sorrow and yet rejoicing

!!! success ""

    Christian joy is rooted in future hope and expectation of a Messiah, of
    Jesus, to come again. It is a profound choice, not the result of current
    circumstances

# Questions

!!! note "1"

    The Israelites choose a path apart from God. As a result, they get exiled
    from their land and dominated by foreign nations. But the prophet Isaiah
    knew that sorrow would not have the final word with these people. He looked
    forward to the day when Yahweh would end pain and corruption to lead them
    into endless, joyful living. Read Isaiah 49:13 and Isaiah 51:11 . What does
    Isaiah tell us about God’s character in these passages? What does Isaiah
    say will happen to God’s people?

!!! scripture "Isaiah 49:13"

    

    13Shout for joy, O heavens! And rejoice, O earth!

    Break forth into joyful shouting, O mountains!

    For the Lord has comforted His people

    And will have compassion on His afflicted.

!!! scripture "Isaiah 51:11"

    11So the ransomed of the Lord will return

    And come with joyful shouting to Zion,

    And everlasting joy will be on their heads.

    They will obtain gladness and joy,

    And sorrow and sighing will flee away.

Isiah tells us that God is good and faithful. He mentions God's past
faithfulness - `For the Lord _has_ comforted His people` as well as future
faithfulness - `So the randomed of the Lord _will_ return...`

Isiah leans in on Yahweh's defining nature from Exodus 34:6. God's `hesed`, his
**steadfase love**, is what is our hope. Otherwise our God is no different than
any powerful but fickle diety. 

Isiah also doesn't, in these short passages, promise or claim a promise of any
kind of temporal happiness - the joy is historical-facing in reflecting on
God's deliverance and future-facing inr reflecting also on God's deliverance.
God's people were still supposed to find this joy in the midst of their bondage.


!!! note "2"

    The prophet Isaiah looked forward to the coming of Israel’s redeemer. His
    prophecies were fulfilled with the arrival of Jesus. Read Luke 2:9-11 . Why
    were the shepherds afraid? What reasons did the angels give for them to
    rejoice instead?

!!! scripture "Luke 2:9-11"

    9And an angel of the Lord suddenly stood before them, and the glory of the
    Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened. 10But the angel
    said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great
    joy which will be for all the people; 11for today in the city of David
    there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.

Presumably the shepherds were afraid because of `the glory of the Lord`. All
throughout the OT we have examples of God's people fearing this glory,
specifically on Sinai. Yahweh even tells Moses that he can only be shown
Yahweh's back due to his glory, and then Moses has to veil his face so that the
glory of the Lord persisted on him would not terrify the Israelites.

The angels outright said that a Savior has been born, the Messiah has come.
There is no greater cause for joy than the king of creation returning

!!! note "3"

    Joy can persist in the harshest of circumstances because it depends on God
    and his promises. Read Matthew 5:11-12 , Acts 13:50-52 , and Hebrews 12:1-3
    . According to these passages, what specific truths about God can sustain
    joy even through painful or dire situations?

!!! success ""

    Joy can persist in the harshest of circumstances because it depends on God
    and his promises.


!!! scripture "Matthew 5:11-12"

    11“Blessed are you when people insult you and persecute you, and falsely
    say all kinds of evil against you because of Me. 12Rejoice and be glad, for
    your reward in heaven is great; for in the same way they persecuted the
    prophets who were before you.

!!! scripture "Acts 13:50-52"

    50But the Jews incited the devout women of prominence and the leading men
    of the city, and instigated a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and
    drove them out of their district. 51But they shook off the dust of their
    feet in protest against them and went to Iconium. 52And the disciples were
    continually filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.


!!! scripture "Hebrews 12:1-3"

    Jesus, the Example

    1Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let
    us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles
    us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2fixing
    our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set
    before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the
    right hand of the throne of God. 3For consider Him who has endured such
    hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and
    lose heart.

1. Harsh treatment of us, particularly for faith, reflects Jesus' life. We stand
with God-incarnate in living for a different kingdom which has negative
consequences for us in the modern age, but obviously not in God's age that's
already here and yet coming.

2. Holy Spirit gives us joy

3. We have long list of people in history who lived faithful lives, struggled
   with God, experienced pain, and yet were faithful the Lord by God's own
   grace. Similarly we are chosen and favored - the receipients of God's
   `hesed` love.

!!! note "4"

    When we see how Jesus’ loving way of life has overcome death itself, joy
    starts to become strangely reasonable. But this doesn’t mean it is wise to
    ignore or suppress sorrow. Read 2 Corinthians 6:3-10 . How did Paul
    integrate both joy and sorrow?

!!! scripture "2 Corinthians 6:3-10"

    3giving no cause for offense in anything, so that the ministry will not be
    discredited, 4but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God, in
    much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses, 5in beatings,
    in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hunger, 6in
    purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in
    genuine love, 7in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the weapons of
    righteousness for the right hand and the left, 8by glory and dishonor, by
    evil report and good report; regarded as deceivers and yet true; 9as
    unknown yet well-known, as dying yet behold, we live; as punished yet not
    put to death, 10as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many
    rich, as having nothing yet possessing all things.
