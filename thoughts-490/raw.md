Here's my thought on <a href="https://docs.openwebui.com/">üí≠ üè° Home | Open WebUI</a>

I've been using openwebui at home, mostly with llama3.2, to do some basic things - meal planning and short script generation. One thing I want to do is generate shrotened versions of my favorite books to read to my kids. For example, the Narnia series. It's already a kid's book, but a 3 year old can't stay focused for even a whole chapter. I'd love for AI to shorten up the narrative to keep the jist of the story but in about 1000 words or so... I haven't gotten it perfect, but openwebui lets me upload documents (for example, a pdf of The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, and then use that for context... It's not quite RAG I don't think, and that's on the list of ideas to play with to this end.
