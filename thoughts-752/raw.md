Here's my thought on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch">ðŸ’­ AI INTERVIEWS ARE HERE!! SO I TROLLED ONE TO SHOW YOU... - You...</a>

AI has provided a lot of value in my life for sure... but it's still not my favorite piece of technology, and the nearish-term-future certainly has some dystopian qualities to it. AI interviews definitely are in that category and Josh does a good and comical job of highlighting the ridiculousness of it. 

I envy no one looking for a job, and I double envy no one who has to deal with AI powered HR solutions...
