<div class="admonition note">
<p>generally means absnese of war</p>
</div>
<p>In Hebrew the word is <code>Shalom</code> (Greek: Eirene). Basic biblical meeting of
Shalom is &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;whole&quot;. ie. a stone with no cracks, or stone wall with
nogaps or missing grips</p>
<p>References a complex situation with nothing missing</p>
<p>Shalom can refer to a person's well-being... Life is complex and when anything
is out of alignment our Shalom breaks down and needs to be restored</p>
<p>To bring shalom is to make complete or restore</p>
<p>In Proverbs, to reconcile a broken relationship is to make shalom</p>

<p>The prophet Isaiah looked forward to the arrival of a future king who would
make a covenant of shalom (peace, well-being) with his people. This king
would set the world right and heal all that has been harmed. Read Isaiah
9:6-7 aloud together. What specific words or phrases stand out to you as
you observe this passage and why?</p>

<p>The prophet Isaiah looked forward to the arrival of the Prince of Peace, whose
reign would lead to eternal shalom. Jesus’ arrival fulfilled Isaiah’s words.
Read and reflect on Luke 2:9-15 as a group. Why do you think God announced the
King’s arrival to no-name shepherds? What does this tell you about the nature
of God and his Kingdom?</p>

Lord shone around them; and they were terribly frightened. 10But the angel
said to them, “Do not be afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of great
joy which will be for all the people; 11for today in the city of David
there has been born for you a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. 12This will
be a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a
manger.” 13And suddenly there appeared with the angel a multitude of the
heavenly host praising God and saying,</p>
<p>14“Glory to God in the highest,</p>
<p>And on earth peace among men with whom He is pleased.”</p>
<p>15When the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds began
saying to one another, “Let us go straight to Bethlehem then, and see this
thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us.”</p>
</div>
<p>At thsi point it seems obvious that the reason God came to the undesirable
company of teh time was to illustrate that the Kingdom of Heaven was to be an
upside down kingdom. Status and power are hinderences under Jesus' reign, so he
builds his kingdom (from our perspective) from the ground up.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">3</p>
<p>The biblical story shows how humanity often chooses a way of life apart
from God and suffers as a result. According to Colossians 1:19-23 , what
did God want to do to remedy this pain, and how did he accomplish his
desire through Jesus?</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition scripture">
<p class="admonition-title">Scripture</p>
<p>Colossians 1:19-23</p>
<p>19For it was the Father’s good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in
Him, 20and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made
peace (εἰρηνοποιέω) through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things on
earth or things in heaven.</p>
<p>21And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in
evil deeds, 22yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through
death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond
reproach— 23if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and
steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have
heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I,
Paul, was made a minister.</p>
</div>
<p>God interacted with Creation as a created being himself, holding back
<em>something</em> in the person of Jesus. On our turf, God showed up to revive our
lifeless souls and call us to live as citizens in his kingdom.</p>

<p>Jesus offers his peace to all people as a gift. Read Ephesians 2:11-16 .
How did Jesus make peace between two sharply divided people groups (Jews
and Gentiles), and why did he do it (see Eph. 2:16)?</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition scripture">
<p class="admonition-title">Ephesians 2:11-16</p>
</div>
<pre><code>11Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are
called “Uncircumcision” by the so-called “Circumcision,” which is performed
in the flesh by human hands— 12remember that you were at that time separate
from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the
covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. 13But
now in Christ Jesus you who formerly were far off have been brought near by
the blood of Christ. 14For He Himself is our peace, who made both groups
into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall, 15by abolishing
in His flesh the enmity, which is the Law of commandments contained in
ordinances, so that in Himself He might make the two into one new man, thus
establishing peace, 

16and might reconcile them both in one body to God
through the cross, by it having put to death the enmity.
</code></pre>
<p>Jesus broke down the dividing wall of Circumcision by fulfilling Torah. No
longer do the people of God need to be circumcized into the covenant (we have
baptism), and no longer are God's people separate from the world via outward
appearances but instead by living lives loyal to a different God - to Yahweh</p>
<div class="admonition success">
<p>Jesus &quot;put to death the enmity&quot; by removing all <em>spiritually/covenantally relevant</em> barriers that separated Jews from Gentiles</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">5</p>
<p>Now, let’s carefully read Ephesians 4:1-3 How can humility, gentleness,
patience, and love help maintain the unity Jesus calls his followers to?
What happens to unity when one of these virtues is missing?</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition scripture">
<p class="admonition-title">Ephesians 4:1-3</p>
<p>1Therefore I, the prisoner of the Lord, implore you to walk in a manner
worthy of the calling with which you have been called, 2with all humility
and gentleness, with patience, showing tolerance for one another in love,
3being diligent to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</p>
</div>
<p>These things don't just help maintain unity - they are the postures of life
Jesus builds his Kingdom around (second to himself I suppose). Jesus levels the
playing field for all people, and no one has anymore right to anything than
anyone else. Things like humility (right view of oneself), gentleness,
patience, love, etc. are necessary for Jesus' kingdom to look how he wants it
to look</p>
