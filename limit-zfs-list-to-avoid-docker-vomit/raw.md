zfs list has a flag -r, but if you use zfs driver for docker then you'll get
flooded with every docker volume in the world. zfs list -r -d N will limit the
dept of the print out, so zfs list -r -d 2 gives me tank, tank/encrypted,
tank/encrypted/docker -> but then I don't see all the continer volumes
