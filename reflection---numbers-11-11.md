  to what I need for the third day in a row...\n\n- [[reflection-1-kings-19-8]] He
  showed me that he sustains me unto his own service and glory\n- [[reflection-john-4-14]]
  He showed me that I've been pushing away aspects of his provision\n\nAnd today I
  see the trials in my life reveal the status of my faith... Last\nnight I got a phone
  call that I missed a credit card payment, which I thought\nodd since everything
  is on auto-pay. Well, turns out our checking account got a\nsmidge low, low enough
  that the credit card payment was cancelled... In reality\nthis isn't a huge deal,
  but it threw me off and continues to this morning. The\ntruth is, the only issue
  is my lack of in-depth understanding of our money\nmovement. Our lifestyle and living
  expenses are well below what we can\notherwise afford, but in my laziness I have
  mostly neglected each of our\naccounts individually. No doubt this \"trial\" is
  self-imposed but Spurgeon's\nmeditation is snapping me out of the funk that threw
  me into last night\n\n!!! success \"fearless faith\"\n\n    If our faith be worth
  anything, it will stand the test. Gilt is afraid of fire, but gold is not: the paste
  gem dreads to be touched by the diamond, but the true jewel fears no test\n\nThe
  text is [Numbers 11:11](https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-11.htm)\n\n!!! note \"Numbers
  11:11\"\n\n    And Moses said to Yahweh, \u201CWhy have you brought trouble to your
  servant? Why have I not found favor in your eyes, that the burdens of all these
  people have been placed on me?\n\nThe meditation came from \"Why have you brought
  trouble to your servant?\"\n\n??? warning \"Meditation vs Homily\"\n\n    My reflections
  over the summer have following the pattern of finding a scripture reference from
  Morning and Evening and then simply asking God to speak through the words of the
  text and Spurgeon's meditation. Historically I would study the text, but in the
  season of life I am in, where I do have years of studious foundation, I am trying
  to exercise trust in God to speak to me in ways outside of connecting theological
  knowledge dots that construct a mosaic of my own choosing. Instead I'm trying to
  just trust his sovereignty - he brought me to Morning and Evening on October 7,
  2025 perhaps so that I could be encouraged in my faith in light of this missed credit
  card payment event/trial. These reflections are not meant to be educational on the
  Bible, or even on theology necessarily - I am practicing opening my mind and heart
  to God speaking to me in ways otherwise uncomfortable but with prudence as I'm not
  approaching these texts in ignorance. As I put these reflections into the world
  I want to be clear these are personal meditations, not Bible lessons\n\n## Reflection\n\nOur
  heavenly Father sends us frequent troubles to try our faith... Are the\nsource of
  those trials my own choices? Other's choices? Some meta-truth about the\nfallenness
  of creation? I think probably it's all of that... In reality, it doesn't\nmatter
  **where** the trial comes from - directly from the heavens above or\noriginating
  in our own mistakes (such as mine of note above). There is almost\ncertainly some
  significance in the source but **ultimately God\nis sovereign over every one of
  those possibilities**, and so in another sense,\nit's almost insignificant what
  I consider the \"source\" of a trial. The real\nissue is how I respond to it.\n\nLast
  night I was filled in my physical chest with a feeling of dread... Seeing\nmy checking
  account low revealed that I have more digging to do to uncover any\ninternal reliance
  on my own systems of security (like money). And the dumb part\ndear reader, is we
  have other accounts and plenty of money... I am in zero\nfinancial strain, but even
  so - seeing the number too low to make one of the\npayments sent my head into a
  whirlwind. God has also already provided a way out\nof this trial... I have budgeting
  software that I've been using for a long time\nand am just not on top of. He gave
  me the software I use and the ability to use\nit but it's my own lack of diligence
  that I think led to this \"trial\". And yet,\nwith all that knowledge I find that
  I'm still troubled... I think I have a\nstrong faith and one of my most common prayer
  is \"Lord help my unbelief\", and\napparently today I need to shout this to the
  heavens. How **dare** I allow\ndread to overcome me when I claim to know my God
  provides.\n\nAnd in that I know he is still sweet to me. I'm a father, and when
  my kids make\na mess of themselves my first response (often, though I'm not perfect)
  to them\nis to kneel and say \"hey I'm here, you're safe\". The trial they make
  for\nthemselves may fill them with the dread I filled myself with last night in\nmissing
  that credit card payment.... If I will approach my kids joyfully in\ntheir own mess,
  and if I write all these pages about God's love for me and his\npeople, then ought
  I not adopt the mindset towrads God that I want my\ndaughter's to have when I come
  to save them?\n\nGod approaches me knowing that missing a credit card payment\nis
  hardly a bigger deal than my 4 year old spilling milk on the table. But my\nworld
  can become small just like their worlds are small and then my issues can\nfeel big.
  I need my heavenly father to kneel next to me and say \"hey I'm here,\nyou're safe\".
  I say I need it, but actually I mean to say that I have it, and\nbecause I have
  it is the only reason I can in-turn treat my daughter's this way\nwhen their problems
  fill their little worlds.\n\nPraise God for trials certainly, for what they reveal
  and for the Gospel truth\nthat by the calling of Jesus our faith can be made pure
  and complete."

    been pushing away aspects of his provision</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And today I see the
    trials in my life reveal the status of my faith... Last\nnight I got a phone call
    that I missed a credit card payment, which I thought\nodd since everything is
    on auto-pay. Well, turns out our checking account got a\nsmidge low, low enough
    that the credit card payment was cancelled... In reality\nthis isn't a huge deal,
    but it threw me off and continues to this morning. The\ntruth is, the only issue
    is my lack of in-depth understanding of our money\nmovement. Our lifestyle and
    living expenses are well below what we can\notherwise afford, but in my laziness
    I have mostly neglected each of our\naccounts individually. No doubt this &quot;trial&quot;
    is self-imposed but Spurgeon's\nmeditation is snapping me out of the funk that
    threw me into last night</p>\n<div class=\"admonition success\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">fearless

    your servant? Why have I not found favor in your eyes, that the burdens of all
    these people have been placed on me?</p>\n</div>\n<p>The meditation came from
    &quot;Why have you brought trouble to your servant?&quot;</p>\n<div class=\"admonition
    warning is-collapsible collapsible-closed\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Meditation
    vs Homily</p>\n<p>My reflections over the summer have following the pattern of
    finding a scripture reference from Morning and Evening and then simply asking
    God to speak through the words of the text and Spurgeon's meditation. Historically
    I would study the text, but in the season of life I am in, where I do have years
    of studious foundation, I am trying to exercise trust in God to speak to me in
    ways outside of connecting theological knowledge dots that construct a mosaic
    of my own choosing. Instead I'm trying to just trust his sovereignty - he brought
    me to Morning and Evening on October 7, 2025 perhaps so that I could be encouraged
    in my faith in light of this missed credit card payment event/trial. These reflections
    are not meant to be educational on the Bible, or even on theology necessarily
    - I am practicing opening my mind and heart to God speaking to me in ways otherwise
    uncomfortable but with prudence as I'm not approaching these texts in ignorance.
    As I put these reflections into the world I want to be clear these are personal
    meditations, not Bible lessons</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"reflection\">Reflection <a

    sends us frequent troubles to try our faith... Are the\nsource of those trials
    my own choices? Other's choices? Some meta-truth about the\nfallenness of creation?
    I think probably it's all of that... In reality, it doesn't\nmatter <strong>where</strong>
    the trial comes from - directly from the heavens above or\noriginating in our
    own mistakes (such as mine of note above). There is almost\ncertainly some significance
    in the source but <strong>ultimately God\nis sovereign over every one of those
    possibilities</strong>, and so in another sense,\nit's almost insignificant what
    I consider the &quot;source&quot; of a trial. The real\nissue is how I respond
    to it.</p>\n<p>Last night I was filled in my physical chest with a feeling of
    dread... Seeing\nmy checking account low revealed that I have more digging to
    do to uncover any\ninternal reliance on my own systems of security (like money).
    And the dumb part\ndear reader, is we have other accounts and plenty of money...
    I am in zero\nfinancial strain, but even so - seeing the number too low to make
    one of the\npayments sent my head into a whirlwind. God has also already provided
    a way out\nof this trial... I have budgeting software that I've been using for
    a long time\nand am just not on top of. He gave me the software I use and the
    ability to use\nit but it's my own lack of diligence that I think led to this
    &quot;trial&quot;. And yet,\nwith all that knowledge I find that I'm still troubled...
    I think I have a\nstrong faith and one of my most common prayer is &quot;Lord
    help my unbelief&quot;, and\napparently today I need to shout this to the heavens.
    How <strong>dare</strong> I allow\ndread to overcome me when I claim to know my
    God provides.</p>\n<p>And in that I know he is still sweet to me. I'm a father,
    and when my kids make\na mess of themselves my first response (often, though I'm
    not perfect) to them\nis to kneel and say &quot;hey I'm here, you're safe&quot;.
    The trial they make for\nthemselves may fill them with the dread I filled myself
    with last night in\nmissing that credit card payment.... If I will approach my
    kids joyfully in\ntheir own mess, and if I write all these pages about God's love
    for me and his\npeople, then ought I not adopt the mindset towrads God that I
    want my\ndaughter's to have when I come to save them?</p>\n<p>God approaches me
    knowing that missing a credit card payment\nis hardly a bigger deal than my 4
    year old spilling milk on the table. But my\nworld can become small just like
    their worlds are small and then my issues can\nfeel big. I need my heavenly father
    to kneel next to me and say &quot;hey I'm here,\nyou're safe&quot;. I say I need
    it, but actually I mean to say that I have it, and\nbecause I have it is the only
    reason I can in-turn treat my daughter's this way\nwhen their problems fill their
    little worlds.</p>\n<p>Praise God for trials certainly, for what they reveal and
    for the Gospel truth\nthat by the calling of Jesus our faith can be made pure
    and complete.</p>\n\n    </section>\n</article>        </div>\n    </main>\n\n</div>\n

    trials in my life reveal the status of my faith... Last\nnight I got a phone call
    that I missed a credit card payment, which I thought\nodd since everything is
    on auto-pay. Well, turns out our checking account got a\nsmidge low, low enough
    that the credit card payment was cancelled... In reality\nthis isn't a huge deal,
    but it threw me off and continues to this morning. The\ntruth is, the only issue
    is my lack of in-depth understanding of our money\nmovement. Our lifestyle and
    living expenses are well below what we can\notherwise afford, but in my laziness
    I have mostly neglected each of our\naccounts individually. No doubt this &quot;trial&quot;
    is self-imposed but Spurgeon's\nmeditation is snapping me out of the funk that
    threw me into last night</p>\n<div class=\"admonition success\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">fearless

    these people have been placed on me?</p>\n</div>\n<p>The meditation came from
    &quot;Why have you brought trouble to your servant?&quot;</p>\n<div class=\"admonition
    warning is-collapsible collapsible-closed\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Meditation
    vs Homily</p>\n<p>My reflections over the summer have following the pattern of
    finding a scripture reference from Morning and Evening and then simply asking
    God to speak through the words of the text and Spurgeon's meditation. Historically
    I would study the text, but in the season of life I am in, where I do have years
    of studious foundation, I am trying to exercise trust in God to speak to me in
    ways outside of connecting theological knowledge dots that construct a mosaic
    of my own choosing. Instead I'm trying to just trust his sovereignty - he brought
    me to Morning and Evening on October 7, 2025 perhaps so that I could be encouraged
    in my faith in light of this missed credit card payment event/trial. These reflections
    are not meant to be educational on the Bible, or even on theology necessarily
    - I am practicing opening my mind and heart to God speaking to me in ways otherwise
    uncomfortable but with prudence as I'm not approaching these texts in ignorance.
    As I put these reflections into the world I want to be clear these are personal
    meditations, not Bible lessons</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"reflection\">Reflection <a

    sends us frequent troubles to try our faith... Are the\nsource of those trials
    my own choices? Other's choices? Some meta-truth about the\nfallenness of creation?
    I think probably it's all of that... In reality, it doesn't\nmatter <strong>where</strong>
    the trial comes from - directly from the heavens above or\noriginating in our
    own mistakes (such as mine of note above). There is almost\ncertainly some significance
    in the source but <strong>ultimately God\nis sovereign over every one of those
    possibilities</strong>, and so in another sense,\nit's almost insignificant what
    I consider the &quot;source&quot; of a trial. The real\nissue is how I respond
    to it.</p>\n<p>Last night I was filled in my physical chest with a feeling of
    dread... Seeing\nmy checking account low revealed that I have more digging to
    do to uncover any\ninternal reliance on my own systems of security (like money).
    And the dumb part\ndear reader, is we have other accounts and plenty of money...
    I am in zero\nfinancial strain, but even so - seeing the number too low to make
    one of the\npayments sent my head into a whirlwind. God has also already provided
    a way out\nof this trial... I have budgeting software that I've been using for
    a long time\nand am just not on top of. He gave me the software I use and the
    ability to use\nit but it's my own lack of diligence that I think led to this
    &quot;trial&quot;. And yet,\nwith all that knowledge I find that I'm still troubled...
    I think I have a\nstrong faith and one of my most common prayer is &quot;Lord
    help my unbelief&quot;, and\napparently today I need to shout this to the heavens.
    How <strong>dare</strong> I allow\ndread to overcome me when I claim to know my
    God provides.</p>\n<p>And in that I know he is still sweet to me. I'm a father,
    and when my kids make\na mess of themselves my first response (often, though I'm
    not perfect) to them\nis to kneel and say &quot;hey I'm here, you're safe&quot;.
    The trial they make for\nthemselves may fill them with the dread I filled myself
    with last night in\nmissing that credit card payment.... If I will approach my
    kids joyfully in\ntheir own mess, and if I write all these pages about God's love
    for me and his\npeople, then ought I not adopt the mindset towrads God that I
    want my\ndaughter's to have when I come to save them?</p>\n<p>God approaches me
    knowing that missing a credit card payment\nis hardly a bigger deal than my 4
    year old spilling milk on the table. But my\nworld can become small just like
    their worlds are small and then my issues can\nfeel big. I need my heavenly father
    to kneel next to me and say &quot;hey I'm here,\nyou're safe&quot;. I say I need
    it, but actually I mean to say that I have it, and\nbecause I have it is the only
    reason I can in-turn treat my daughter's this way\nwhen their problems fill their
    little worlds.</p>\n<p>Praise God for trials certainly, for what they reveal and
    for the Gospel truth\nthat by the calling of Jesus our faith can be made pure
    and complete.</p>\n\n    </section>\n</article>"

    that I missed a credit card payment, which I thought\nodd since everything is

    that the credit card payment was cancelled... In reality\nthis isn't a huge deal,
    but it threw me off and continues to this morning. The\ntruth is, the only issue
    is my lack of in-depth understanding of our money\nmovement. Our lifestyle and
    living expenses are well below what we can\notherwise afford, but in my laziness
    I have mostly neglected each of our\naccounts individually. No doubt this &quot;trial&quot;

    vs Homily</p>\n<p>My reflections over the summer have following the pattern of
    finding a scripture reference from Morning and Evening and then simply asking
    God to speak through the words of the text and Spurgeon's meditation. Historically
    I would study the text, but in the season of life I am in, where I do have years
    of studious foundation, I am trying to exercise trust in God to speak to me in
    ways outside of connecting theological knowledge dots that construct a mosaic
    of my own choosing. Instead I'm trying to just trust his sovereignty - he brought
    me to Morning and Evening on October 7, 2025 perhaps so that I could be encouraged
    in my faith in light of this missed credit card payment event/trial. These reflections
    are not meant to be educational on the Bible, or even on theology necessarily
    - I am practicing opening my mind and heart to God speaking to me in ways otherwise
    uncomfortable but with prudence as I'm not approaching these texts in ignorance.
    As I put these reflections into the world I want to be clear these are personal
    meditations, not Bible lessons</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"reflection\">Reflection <a

    sends us frequent troubles to try our faith... Are the\nsource of those trials
    my own choices? Other's choices? Some meta-truth about the\nfallenness of creation?
    I think probably it's all of that... In reality, it doesn't\nmatter <strong>where</strong>
    the trial comes from - directly from the heavens above or\noriginating in our
    own mistakes (such as mine of note above). There is almost\ncertainly some significance
    in the source but <strong>ultimately God\nis sovereign over every one of those
    possibilities</strong>, and so in another sense,\nit's almost insignificant what
    I consider the &quot;source&quot; of a trial. The real\nissue is how I respond
    to it.</p>\n<p>Last night I was filled in my physical chest with a feeling of
    dread... Seeing\nmy checking account low revealed that I have more digging to
    do to uncover any\ninternal reliance on my own systems of security (like money).
    And the dumb part\ndear reader, is we have other accounts and plenty of money...
    I am in zero\nfinancial strain, but even so - seeing the number too low to make
    one of the\npayments sent my head into a whirlwind. God has also already provided
    a way out\nof this trial... I have budgeting software that I've been using for
    a long time\nand am just not on top of. He gave me the software I use and the
    ability to use\nit but it's my own lack of diligence that I think led to this
    &quot;trial&quot;. And yet,\nwith all that knowledge I find that I'm still troubled...
    I think I have a\nstrong faith and one of my most common prayer is &quot;Lord
    help my unbelief&quot;, and\napparently today I need to shout this to the heavens.
    How <strong>dare</strong> I allow\ndread to overcome me when I claim to know my
    God provides.</p>\n<p>And in that I know he is still sweet to me. I'm a father,
    and when my kids make\na mess of themselves my first response (often, though I'm
    not perfect) to them\nis to kneel and say &quot;hey I'm here, you're safe&quot;.
    The trial they make for\nthemselves may fill them with the dread I filled myself
    with last night in\nmissing that credit card payment.... If I will approach my
    kids joyfully in\ntheir own mess, and if I write all these pages about God's love
    for me and his\npeople, then ought I not adopt the mindset towrads God that I
    want my\ndaughter's to have when I come to save them?</p>\n<p>God approaches me
    knowing that missing a credit card payment\nis hardly a bigger deal than my 4
    year old spilling milk on the table. But my\nworld can become small just like
    their worlds are small and then my issues can\nfeel big. I need my heavenly father
    to kneel next to me and say &quot;hey I'm here,\nyou're safe&quot;. I say I need
    it, but actually I mean to say that I have it, and\nbecause I have it is the only
    reason I can in-turn treat my daughter's this way\nwhen their problems fill their
    little worlds.</p>\n<p>Praise God for trials certainly, for what they reveal and

    I am trying to exercise trust in God to speak to me in ways outside of connecting
    theological knowledge dots that construct a mosaic of my own choosing. Instead
    I'm trying to just trust his sovereignty - he brought me to Morning and Evening
    on October 7, 2025 perhaps so that I could be encouraged in my faith in light
    of this missed credit card payment event/trial. These reflections are not meant

    opening my mind and heart to God speaking to me in ways otherwise uncomfortable

    from the heavens above or\noriginating in our own mistakes (such as mine of note
    above). There is almost\ncertainly some significance in the source but **ultimately

    digging to do to uncover any\ninternal reliance on my own systems of security
    (like money). And the dumb part\ndear reader, is we have other accounts and plenty
    of money... I am in zero\nfinancial strain, but even so - seeing the number too
    low to make one of the\npayments sent my head into a whirlwind. God has also already
    provided a way out\nof this trial... I have budgeting software that I've been
    using for a long time\nand am just not on top of. He gave me the software I use
    and the ability to use\nit but it's my own lack of diligence that I think led
    to this \"trial\". And yet,\nwith all that knowledge I find that I'm still troubled...
    I think I have a\nstrong faith and one of my most common prayer is \"Lord help
    my unbelief\", and\napparently today I need to shout this to the heavens. How
    **dare** I allow\ndread to overcome me when I claim to know my God provides.\n\nAnd
    in that I know he is still sweet to me. I'm a father, and when my kids make\na
    mess of themselves my first response (often, though I'm not perfect) to them\nis
    to kneel and say \"hey I'm here, you're safe\". The trial they make for\nthemselves
    may fill them with the dread I filled myself with last night in\nmissing that
    credit card payment.... If I will approach my kids joyfully in\ntheir own mess,
    and if I write all these pages about God's love for me and his\npeople, then ought
    I not adopt the mindset towrads God that I want my\ndaughter's to have when I
    come to save them?\n\nGod approaches me knowing that missing a credit card payment\nis
    hardly a bigger deal than my 4 year old spilling milk on the table. But my\nworld

As if the Lord orchestrated Spurgeon's meditation to give me a spring board to what I need for the third day in a row...

- [[reflection-1-kings-19-8]] He showed me that he sustains me unto his own service and glory
- [[reflection-john-4-14]] He showed me that I've been pushing away aspects of his provision

And today I see the trials in my life reveal the status of my faith... Last
night I got a phone call that I missed a credit card payment, which I thought
odd since everything is on auto-pay. Well, turns out our checking account got a
smidge low, low enough that the credit card payment was cancelled... In reality
this isn't a huge deal, but it threw me off and continues to this morning. The
truth is, the only issue is my lack of in-depth understanding of our money
movement. Our lifestyle and living expenses are well below what we can
otherwise afford, but in my laziness I have mostly neglected each of our
accounts individually. No doubt this "trial" is self-imposed but Spurgeon's
meditation is snapping me out of the funk that threw me into last night

!!! success "fearless faith"

    If our faith be worth anything, it will stand the test. Gilt is afraid of fire, but gold is not: the paste gem dreads to be touched by the diamond, but the true jewel fears no test

The text is [Numbers 11:11](https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-11.htm)

!!! note "Numbers 11:11"

    And Moses said to Yahweh, “Why have you brought trouble to your servant? Why have I not found favor in your eyes, that the burdens of all these people have been placed on me?

The meditation came from "Why have you brought trouble to your servant?"

??? warning "Meditation vs Homily"

    My reflections over the summer have following the pattern of finding a scripture reference from Morning and Evening and then simply asking God to speak through the words of the text and Spurgeon's meditation.

## Reflection

Our heavenly Father sends us frequent troubles to try our faith... Are the
source of those trials my own choices? Other's choices? Some meta-truth about the
fallenness of creation? I think probably it's all of that... In reality, it doesn't
matter **where** the trial comes from - directly from the heavens above or
originating in our own mistakes (such as mine of note above). There is almost
certainly some significance in the source but **ultimately God
is sovereign over every one of those possibilities**, and so in another sense,
it's almost insignificant what I consider the "source" of a trial. The real
issue is how I respond to it.

Last night I was filled in my physical chest with a feeling of dread... Seeing
my checking account low revealed that I have more digging to do to uncover any
internal reliance on my own systems of security (like money). And the dumb part
dear reader, is we have other accounts and plenty of money... I am in zero
financial strain, but even so - seeing the number too low to make one of the
payments sent my head into a whirlwind. God has also already provided a way out
of this trial... I have budgeting software that I've been using for a long time
and am just not on top of. He gave me the software I use and the ability to use
it but it's my own lack of diligence that I think led to this "trial". And yet,
with all that knowledge I find that I'm still troubled... I think I have a
strong faith and one of my most common prayer is "Lord help my unbelief", and
apparently today I need to shout this to the heavens. How **dare** I allow
dread to overcome me when I claim to know my God provides.

And in that I know he is still sweet to me. I'm a father, and when my kids make
a mess of themselves my first response (often, though I'm not perfect) to them
is to kneel and say "hey I'm here, you're safe". The trial they make for
themselves may fill them with the dread I filled myself with last night in
missing that credit card payment.... If I will approach my kids joyfully in
their own mess, and if I write all these pages about God's love for me and his
people, then ought I not adopt the mindset towrads God that I want my
daughter's to have when I come to save them?

God approaches me knowing that missing a credit card payment
is hardly a bigger deal than my 4 year old spilling milk on the table. But my
world can become small just like their worlds are small and then my issues can
feel big. I need my heavenly father to kneel next to me and say "hey I'm here,
you're safe". I say I need it, but actually I mean to say that I have it, and
because I have it is the only reason I can in-turn treat my daughter's this way
when their problems fill their little worlds.

Praise God for trials certainly, for what they reveal and for the Gospel truth
that by the calling of Jesus our faith can be made pure and complete.
