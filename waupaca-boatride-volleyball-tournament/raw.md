## 2025

- Played with Ming, John, and Daniel
- We honestly didn't play great - some good passes but many errors definitely lost us our games
- I must've missed 7 or 8 serves and 2 were game point (we then lost those games)
- Overall had a blast - we played `B LEAGUE` which is 100% appropriate... already looking forward to next year

### Packing Notes

- I overpacked this year (shocker)
- Items for next year:
  - Better canopy with sides
  - pop up table
  - camp stove (talk to ming about this)
  - nicer chairs
  - towel
  - less clothes...
  - trail running shoes were PERFECT
  - Epoch sunnies or similar
  - UV hoodie
  - anker solix power bank
    - 3 outlets
    - usb
