!!! note "Mark 12:29-30"

    29 Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Listen, Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is one. 30 And you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.’

## The Most Important Commandment

!!! note "Deuteronomy 6:4-5"

    4 “Hear, Israel, Yahweh our God, Yahweh is unique. 5 And you shall love Yahweh your God with all of your heart and with all of your soul and with all of your might.

Jesus quotes the Shema as the most important commandment - not really
surprising... Yahweh's authority and divine kingship is the most important
reality to affirm. Along with recognizing the authority and Oneness of Yahweh
is the command the love him. ie. Not loving him is **not** recognizing his
authority... Again, not a surprising thing to hear a king say.

So he says the most important thing is to love Yahweh Elohim (the Lord your
God) with everything. This calls Paul's words about transformation to mind -

!!! note "Romans 12:1-2"

    Therefore I exhort you, brothers, through the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service. 2 And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, so that you may approve what is the good and well-pleasing and perfect will of God.

Paul says that to offer ourselves as a **living sacraifice** (strong language, no?)
is our **reasonable service**... If we think about Jesus' words that the **most
important commandment** is to love God with everything, then Paul's words here
in Romans are honestly just a natural outpouring of that priority - that we are
to offer **everything** back to him.

One lens through which to view this is simply gratitude... If you are given
everything by someone, of course you'd seek to show your thanks. Part of the
human experience for the Christian, I think anyways, is the maturing and
realization of **how much** God has given, and how much he has saved me from. This
maturity leads me to love God more deeply... It's as if my perspective on what
he's done for me grows, so too my love for him grows.

    The "everything" I have to offer increases as I become more aware of everything he's given.

Praise God for the mercies on my life, the greatest of which is the freedom to
offer myself to him. In the bonds of sin and shame I'm not free to crawl up
onto the altar as a living sacrifice. But God, in his grace, brought me to
life. He animated my body, makes it sacred space, and in the life-giving power
of Jesus' resurrection and the Holy Spirit I should walk myself to the altar
and lay myself down. The most important command for me is to love him with
everything, and praise the Lord I am free to do so.
