Here's my thought on <a href="https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/news">ðŸ’­ News - Apps - App Store - Nextcloud</a>

I just started using FreshRSS to get familiar with subscribing to RSS feeds and leaning into that as opposed to social media... Twitter has become basically just a news outlet for me, not a place to connect with devs (except for 2 or 3 who are active). RSS seems like such cool and ancient technology that is protected from the corporate tentacles that hold up every social media outlet save for nostr... 

So as I look for an RSS reader and/or feed aggregator this Nextcloud plugin seems like a good choice to look at since I'm already hosting NC.. although do I really want to lean into it for more and more?
