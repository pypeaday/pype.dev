<p class="admonition-title">Isaiah 51:1-3</p>
<p>1 “Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness,  who seek Yahweh.  Look to
the rock from which you were hewn,  and to the excavation of the pit from which
you were quarried.
2 Look to Abraham your father,  and to Sarah; she brought
you forth.  For I called him alone,  but I blessed him and made him numerous.”
3 For Yahweh will comfort Zion;  he will comfort all its sites of ruins.  And
he will make its wilderness like Eden,  and its desert like the garden of
Yahweh.  Joy and gladness will be found in it,  thanksgiving and the sound of
song.</p>

<p>On the heels of yesterday, I'm still struggling with Joy, but here in Isaiah
some context aligns Joy with Gladness (which feels very much in-line with my
association of Gratitude with Happiness).</p>
<p>So where will joy and gladness be found? It sounds to me like &quot;Zion&quot;. Zion is
the Mountain of God. In the ANE gods lived on high mountain tops with lush
gardens. Think of the cartoon example of Hercules with the pantheon up on
Olympus.</p>
<p>Zion is also the people of God - even today we sometimes use national or ethnic
titles to refer to the people of that area. National leaders may address the
citizens of America by saying &quot;Listen to me, America&quot; or something like that -
I think my point is that we'd all &quot;get it&quot; in that moment. In a similar way,
that communication shouldn't be lost on us here.</p>
<p>The prophet is speaking to &quot;you who pursue righteousness, who seek Yahweh...
Yahweh will comfort Zion (you)...&quot;. In that comfort is 2 things from this
passage: Election and Legacy.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Election</p>
<p>&quot;Look to the rock from which you were hewn...&quot;. Does the rock decide which
pieces are chiseled away and which pieces remain? Of course not, the sculptor
or foreman does that. In, honestly, the same way - who am I to have chosen God
on my own... Without his hand coming to the rock to separate me (any anyone
else in the Lord) I would forever remain stagnant in my cold, hard, dead state.
But Yahweh chooses - and what can follow his choice to hewn me from the rock?
Why, it's nothing but Joy and Gladness!</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Legacy</p>
<p>&quot;Look to Abraham your father, and to Sarah; she brought you forth&quot;. God's
people have a long legacy, a real legacy, to look back on and be encouraged by
God's faithfulness in his election. The legacy isn't just back to &quot;Father
Abraham&quot;, my mind goes to my own life and now that I have some years under my
belt I can look back and see time and time again where God showed his love for
me in extraordinary ways. I do hope it isn't the physical blessings that he
gives that bring me joy, but rather that it is the unending history of
faithfulness to me as his child.</p>
</div>
<p>Joy is found in Zion because it is where Yahweh lives, and joy and gladness are
found in fullness in him alone. His comfort today is realized in his word and
legacy of faithfulness, and his comfort tomorrow will be realized by Jesus'
return and the consummation of the Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Work is hard, life is unfair, sickness will continue but at the appointed time,
when Yahweh &quot;make[s] [Zion's] wilderness like Eden&quot; there will be joy,
gladness, thanksgiving, and the sound of song.</p>
