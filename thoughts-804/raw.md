Here's my thought on <a href="https://docs.codeberg.org/codeberg-pages/">ðŸ’­ Codeberg Pages | Codeberg Documentation</a>

Forgejo has a github pages like feature... this might be nice to use sometime as I try to lean into forgejo, but the last thought/bookmark on using traefik + nginx in a compose stack feels simple too. I'll keep it in mind as I explore the forgejo setup at home

After reading it again I missed something. Codeberg pages is not exactly like github pages, seems more like the github readme thing - you have to use a repo called "pages" and then you'll get {username}.codeberg.page... so they own this TLD, and so I'm not sure it's worth exploring this for homelab situations when traefik + nginx or something is pretty simple as well
