Independence Day has become more important to me as I've gained some
perspective on the world, and learned that in the US of A we have it pretty
dang good... yes there's corrpution up the chain and the government is a wreck,
but at the day to day level for an individual setting 2 feet on God's green
earth... there's a LOT worse places on the earth to be. And so as we all
celebrate with cookouts and stuff I was getting ready to have a great time with
some friends enjoying that tastey freedom... But here's what happened. We
hosted this gathering and pretty clearly scheduled it until 630 PM which is
when we typically get our daughters ready for bed (yes yes early bedtime...
they're up PLENTY early so don't you worry). Anyways, my entire life as I've
had some kind of boundary to keep personally, I've had to make sure that that
boundary was respected very actively, or work to remind people of it...
Overstaying your welcome is a general example here... Great guests know when
it's time to leave and don't make it your responsibility to end the time of
hanging out. And honestly that's the whole post... Today all of our friends
were mindful of the time, gave their kiddos adequate warnings, and everyone's
cars were gone by 6:38... I found myself SHOCKED and concerned that I had
offended everyone who couldn't wait to leave. But no... it was our friends
knowing our boundary and not making it my responsibility to kick everyone out.
They're good friends who know our girls go to bed early. THe thing I am struck
by is in mulling over the concern of having offended someone what I realized is
that my friends here freed me from having to protect my own boundaries and it's
hard to put that into words... But I am grateful to have a community that is
considerate of others (ie. me and my family).
