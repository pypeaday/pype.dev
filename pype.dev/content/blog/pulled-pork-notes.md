I smoked 2 pork shoulders

1. Heavy application of Jack Daniels default pork rub + Meat Church's the Holy Gospel
2. Hot Honey Ham + Perfect Pork (festival)

They smoked with Traegar's Signature pellets at 250 until internal temp of 205,
then they rest covered for a few hours, then tear apart...

overall rating:

The Hot Honey Ham + Perfect Pork tasted great. It was not that spicy at all, good flavor. It ended up being a little dry but this was certainly cause of my utter lack of attention while the meat is smoking
