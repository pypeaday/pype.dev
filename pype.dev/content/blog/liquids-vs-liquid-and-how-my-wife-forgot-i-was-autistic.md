# A Comical Story

My wife said a somewhat rhetorical question yesterday "is it liquid or liquids
when..." and I frankly don't remember the exact ending. I thought it was a
curious statement so I launched into my own explanation...

???+ note "\*_Liquids vs Liquid_"

    Liquid is used regardless of the quantity of a single liquid, or if you are referring to a combination of different liquids that group together in a similar way... So if you had a lot of apple juice, you could say "that's a lot of liquid", and if you had apple juice and orange juice, you could still say "that's a lot of liquid" because the "liquid" isn't the specific _kind_ of juice here, it's the amount of _juice_.

She cut me off right at the end to lovingly comment **I forgot for a second that you were autistic**.
