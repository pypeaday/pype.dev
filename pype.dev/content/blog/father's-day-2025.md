Okay, now that we're back, I just wanted to capture some thoughts on Father's Day and
how becoming a dad and raising two beautiful kids has affected my view on, or matured my
view of, my relationship with God and how He sees me. Because, biblically speaking,
the father metaphor is very common and prominent for Yahweh. He's many things to His chosen
people. But the theology of adoption makes the father model and metaphor, I don't know,
a good one. And being a dad, I feel like I've learned a lot. This is pretty related to the
last post of mine on a new perspective on being God's child, where the crux of that post is that,
as smart as we might think we are as educated theologians, in the eyes of God we're still
just children. And I mean that we should think our understanding of our complex topics,
our understanding is still the level of a child in relation to God. And so in that same vein,
what else is, and what other ways am I like a child to God, maybe, is the way to think about
this. I remember both of my kids as babies would get overtired, and they'd be so tired that they
couldn't fall asleep. And I would look at them and go, this doesn't make sense. Your body knows you
need sleep, you know you need sleep, but what does it mean to be too tired? You can't fall asleep.
And you just yell and scream at me. But that baby doesn't know, you know, that I'm, they don't know
anything. They're just overtired, and they're yelling and screaming. It's just my job to protect
them in that moment, comfort them, whatever. And I thought, man, this just has to be how God sees
me sometimes. Even though I've been walking with the Lord for decades, and whatever, I grew up in
the church, and I do consider myself somewhat of an educated Christian, there's got to be times
when I'm just throwing a tantrum. And that's how God sees me, as a creature he loves, who's just
too tired to take a nap. And it's a humbling thing to think that that's really sometimes how God sees
me. And as my kids have gotten older, I think that I've picked up on other truths of the Lord, how
he can love me even when I sin, even when my daughters disobey, doesn't change my love for
them. And I understand that concept so much better than, I mean, it was impossible for me to understand
that, I think, to some degree, before having kids. I just had an experience today with my daughter who
climbed up too high on a swing set on a trapeze bar and couldn't get herself down. And I walked
her through that I told her not to get up there, and she disobeyed. And by disobeying, she put
herself into a dangerous and scary situation. And the help I can provide is to not remove her from
the situation, i.e. to pick her up and just save her, but I could help her climb down and give her
instruction. And she needs to choose to trust me, even though she'll still be scared, and she needs
to choose to trust me, even when I'm not standing where she wants me to stand, or putting my hand
where she wants me to put my hand, so that she feels safe. I need her to know that she is safe,
and to trust that I tell her she is safe, even when she doesn't see it or feel it. And that is
what God requests and demands of me, is to trust him more than I might be fearful of my future,
financially, or of relational security, or whatever.
That trust doesn't necessarily take away the fear, but it does mean that you behave
obediently and act in accordance with the reality, not with the fear. The reality is that
Yahweh loves and protects me, just as I love and protect my daughter, even when she was scared on
the trapeze bar. So Father's Day is, for me, a good time to just reflect on what that means
to be a dad. I'm not going to celebrate and do anything crazy. My family isn't going to, because
I don't want us to. But this is a nice reminder, perhaps I should do this more purposefully, more
often, is reflect on how my kids, how God teaches me about his love for me through giving me a deep
love for my children.
