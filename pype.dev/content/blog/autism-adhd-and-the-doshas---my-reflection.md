## Introduction

I was recently diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder Level 1 and ADHD, the inattentive
type. I suppose, AuDHD for short.
There are many reasons why I now how this official label of AuDHD, not that I
was hoping for it, but due to a childhood behavioral disorder diagnosis and a
desire to understand myself better, I decided to start considering a something
that my childhood issue was misunderstood.
But what started as simply considering some new diagnosis turned into a larger
worldview shift when it comes to medicine and how we treat people for things we
label disorderly.

### Personal History

A brief history lesson for context is that I was diagnosed with bipolar
disorder, but not specifically type 1 or type 2. This diagnosis came about two
times, once in my late childhood and again when I was 19.
The diagnosis never made a ton of sense to me, but it seemed to almost match some of
the things that my mom specifically was concerned about.
There is another point for later on, which is that part of me wanted to be bipolar.
I felt like it would be cool, but also it made me special.

Once I started kind of thinking for myself a little bit - the bipolar diagnosis
was one of my first spiritual challenges in understanding the brokenness of
humanity.
Because I believe in an orderly God, the creator of all things, who makes
things both soundly and reasonable. And I also had a deep desire to see
something miraculous, and so I backed myself into this way of thinking that
taking medicine must be fighting something that God wants to do in me with this
brokenness. I felt like I was trying to do something maybe God didn't want me to
do, but was also wrestling with "but if something's really wrong (which is
possible because we live in a broken world) God gifts these doctors to come up
with this medicine to help heal some of the brokenness."

So I had these two competing ideas that were very loud in my head.

So I've been more at less at peace with the idea that behavior disorders are
apart of life for many people, and thus as I've gotten older and reflected on
being bi-polar I couldn't help but notice that hardly any part of the atypical
pieces of myself matched up with bi-polar at all... Around the time I started
to notice this my wife began wondering if I had something more akin to ADD. We
didn't really understand what that meant, or how it has changed over the years,
or any of it - but based on some initial stereotypes ADHD began to become a
common thing we discussed
After some more legitimate research we both became pretty convinced that I was
measurably on the Autism Specrum and that certainly there were ADHD tendencies
that negatively affected my life. I talked with my doctor and after several
psych evaluations it turns out that my self-diagnosis was consistent with the
conclusion of the evaluation. So if this was the end then my thought would've
been "ok I'm not bi-polar, I'm AuDHD - there's some coping mechanisms I can
learn now and things make sense"... But there's a lot more here and as we look
ahead, I want to be clear that I take no special pride in the AuDHD label...
I'll talk about myself with this label as a way of communicating with people who
understand it, but the main point of this post will be in how understanding
myself as a human being more holistically led to a different point of view of
what the West calls neurodivergencies.
