# Presence of an Expert

Our AC died, or has been showing signs of dying recently, and regardless of the
finality of its death, our house hasn't been getting super cold... The
condenser unit is from 1991, making it 34 years old at the time of this post...

The reason I'm writing though is that I was presented with a nice moment of
reflection when the HVAC guy who came over to service our unit was talking to
me about his diagnostic process. I wouldn't even try to regurgiate everything
because I barely understood it, something about a valve being stuck and not
allowing enough refrigerant through was the root cause of the issue...

Anyways, the root cause aside, this guy KNEW HVAC... it was clear. He
understood every aspect of my AC and furnace within a few minutes of being in
the basement. And that was a surreal moment, to realize I was in the presence
of an absolute expert - just not in anything I could remotely understand.
