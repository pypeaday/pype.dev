I started deploying a website to Cloudflare on a branch called `pages`. Similar to one of the GH Pages deployment patterns. But when my CI was pushing the branch I couldn't see it locally...

`git fetch -a` wasn't pulling any new branches, and `git branch -a` was only showing my development and main branches at the remote... so what gives?

I checked my git config, and to this moment I have no idea how this happened but check out my fetch config:
```
git config --get remote.origin.fetch
+refs/tags/*:refs/tags/*
```

So to fix this:

```
git config remote.origin.fetch '+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*'
```

Now `git fetch -a` works again
```
> git fetch -a
