# TL;DR

As the nextcloud docs say... if you want to write to an external volume that
location has to be writeable by the user/group `www-data` on the host system...
so if that makes sense to you then this TIL probably isn't a ton of value.. if
not however, read on :)



# Case Study

You want to self-host your own cloud and use a smart file system for convenience...
Nextcloud and ZFS are pretty common goto answers for each of those problems.

My home NAS is built on ZFS and among other things I have a `zpool` named
`tank` and nested in there is a `tank/nas` dataset with several child zfs
datasets under that.

I want to use nextcloud mainly for auto-uploading photos from my wife's and my phones for automatic backups.
The issue is that the nextcloud application (I run in Docker) is fixed as the
`www-data` user and so any volume/folder that you want nextcloud to write to
needs to be permissioned such that `www-data` owns it... but I don't want
`www-data` to own everything in my NAS... so what's a girl to do?

# Solution

Well, one way to go is to just utilize docker volumes, write the data in the
container to `/var/www/html` and let that be the place your data backsup to.

I still wanted nextcloud to automatically write right to my NAS so I created a
`nextcloud-upload` directory inside of `tank/nas/media/photos` (photos cause
that's all that gets automatically uploaded)

Then I `chown -R www-data:www-data /tank/nas/media/photos/nextcloud-upload` so
that just that sub-folder is owned by `www-data`. Now everyone's happy!
