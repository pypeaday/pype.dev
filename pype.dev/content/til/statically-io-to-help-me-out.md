[statically.io](https://statically.io) offers a CDN that I'm going to try to lean into for images in my blog. My hope is that the builds get and stay fast, and that page loads are fast too.

Example:

```html

<img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/pypeaday/images.pype.dev/main/static/skimpy-zsh.png" alt="Skimpy ZSH" title="A fancy data summary in the shell" />
```

<img src="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/pypeaday/images.pype.dev/main/static/skimpy-zsh.png" alt="Skimpy ZSH" title="A fancy data summary in the shell" />
