# Install
For ubuntu/debian based distros (which is what I primarly use presently)

`sudo apt update -y && sudo apt install smartmontools -y`

# List hard drives

`lsblk | grep disk` is one way or `sudo lshw -c disk` is another

# smartctl 

Use a device's logical name such as `dev/sda`, not a partition of the disk

`sudo smartctl -t short /dev/sda`

```console
dotfiles   home   ×3  ×2  ×2 via   v3.10.6(dotfiles)  took 11s
❯ sudo smartctl -t short /dev/sda
