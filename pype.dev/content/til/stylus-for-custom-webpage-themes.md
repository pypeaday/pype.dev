the Logos web app is DISGUSTINGY bright/white - enough to actually ruin your morning...

Thankfully there's an extension called [stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/) and some kind folks in the Logos community created a nice dark theme [here](https://userstyles.world/style/18547/logos-web-app-dark-mode). You simply install the extension, then go to the userstyles link <-- and click `install`. It only changes themes for the sites configured - in this case [app.logos.com](app.logos.com)
