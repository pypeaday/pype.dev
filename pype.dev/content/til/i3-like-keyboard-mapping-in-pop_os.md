I was introduced to tiling window managers through i3, which I use heavily on
one of my machines. I have switched to Pop_OS! at home though, which has a
tiling window mode but the keybindings are not what I'm used to for i3. I
wanted to at least navigate workspaces how I'm used to doing (cause I set
workspace 3 for communication apps, 1 for my terminal, etc...)

Here's how I set keybindings for:

* `<Super> + <number>` sends me to that numbered workspace
* `<Shift> + <Super> + <number>` moves the window I'm focused on to workspace `number`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
gsettings set org.gnome.mutter dynamic-workspaces false 
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences num-workspaces 8 
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.keybindings switch-to-application-1 []

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings move-to-workspace-10 "['<Super><Shift>0']"
```
