# Hellenism

> For the first time in history, Greeks redefined worldfiew to be cenetered
> around the individual. Prior to Hellenism, worldviews centered around
> pleasing the gods

`Alexander the Great` had his own _gospel_ (εὐαγγέλιον - euangelion: predates biblical authors. "Good news to share" as an idea is not uniquely biblical)

He conqoured the world, not with a huge army but with 4 things:

1. Education
2. Healthcare
3. Entertainment
4. Athletics

These 4 things pull on basically all people's values, Andrew the Great used them to control people...

1. Education - control what people know
2. Healthcare - make people dependent on the state's provision
3. Entertainment - control what people do with their time (theater was invented in this time)
4. Athletics - similar to entertainment - this becomes a pillar of culture

## Post-Alexander the Great's death

4 rulers take over the Greek kingdom

1. Synichus
2. ?
3. Seleucis
4. Ptolemy

## Ptolemy rules the Jewish region

Leadership style - very Hellenistic

Some Jews dove in, others remained faithful to Judaism... Psolemy made it just simply ahrd to _not be Greek_

## Selucids take over Psolemies and Jewish region

Selucis sacrifices a pig on the altar in Judea - ruthless take over of Jewish
land which leads to the Maccabean revolt (Hanukkah)

### Hanukkah

Jews wins the Maccabean revolts, story of Hanukkah arises

## Hasmonean rule

Maccabean's are people of the text and see that Yahweh wanted priests to rule,
not kings. So they hand the kingdom over to the Hasmoneans (priests), and their
Yahweh-centric rule eventually turns back to Hellenism

_Josephus (perhaps a little hyperbolically) said at this time there weren't enough priests to run Sabbath services cause they were all at the naked mud wrestling tournaments_

## Hasadim

Maccabeans who leave the Hasmonean group, go north, and build a fundamentalist Jewish culture in Galilee which is where Jesus grew up and did his ministry

They split into 2 groups - Zealots who use the sword, Pharisees who obedience to the text

## Rome

Jews (Saducees) persue Herod the Great in order to work things in light of Roman conquest, to remain good for the Jews


Herod and Ceasar end up having a tight political relationship

### Herod's kingdom

Herod split his kingdom to his sons after his death

1. Herod Archelaus (rules for a short time and is replaced by Pontius Pilot)
2. Herod Philip 2
3. Herod Antipad

Sometime in this period, Jesus was born

## Post-Herod

Jesus' public ministry is during this time

Jews eventually revolt against Rome which leads to destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple
