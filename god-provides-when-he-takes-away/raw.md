This post is meant to serve as a reminder that God's provision is about more
than the chronology of things happening... For example he brought me a job when
I lost my main one - he just brought that to me before I lost it... the timing
of that event make it no less significant or caused by God... He answered the
prayer I hadn't uttered yet when it comes to providing for my family

I believe one way God provides in the midst of taking things away is through
living a life of daily submission to him. The idea that it goes:
1. something bad happens
2. pray for protection
3. maybe something happens and the reality of what happens affects my view of God

is silly, selfish, and misguided.

God sometimes provides by gifting you in a way that ends up protecting you
later - but to make the claim the gift was honed solely by you, or worse - a
product of yourself, is to make a grave theological error... God's provision is
a daily journey with him, not a hail mary prayer for a last second safety net...
