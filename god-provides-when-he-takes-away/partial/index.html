            <p>This post is meant to serve as a reminder that God's provision is about more
than the chronology of things happening... For example he brought me a job when
I lost my main one - he just brought that to me before I lost it... the timing
of that event make it no less significant or caused by God... He answered the
prayer I hadn't uttered yet when it comes to providing for my family</p>
<p>I believe one way God provides in the midst of taking things away is through
living a life of daily submission to him. The idea that it goes:</p>
<ol>
<li>something bad happens</li>
<li>pray for protection</li>
<li>maybe something happens and the reality of what happens affects my view of God</li>
</ol>
<p>is silly, selfish, and misguided.</p>
<p>God sometimes provides by gifting you in a way that ends up protecting you
later - but to make the claim the gift was honed solely by you, or worse - a
product of yourself, is to make a grave theological error... God's provision is
a daily journey with him, not a hail mary prayer for a last second safety net...</p>
