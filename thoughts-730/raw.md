I use kanboard to keep myself focused at home - it's great because it's simple enough but does have complex features (that I largely don't need). It's got a great REST API for integrations and looks decent.
Well today I discovered "plugins" for it - and those make it even better - tis BigBoard plugin gives me a way better view of my projects, letting me minimize the ones I don't need to look at "right now" but not using any weird search filters or anything - a simple intuitive "big board" of my projects and their subsequent tasks.
Very excited to find some more useful plugins!
