Here's my thought on <a href="https://drmsh.com/genesis-1-and-its-ane-polemic-part-2/">ðŸ’­ Genesis 1 and Its ANE Polemic, Part 2 - Dr. Michael Heiser</a>

---

I'm preparing for a conversation on Genesis 1 this morning, and so I of course wanted to read through a few of Mike's old posts... I'm going to write a longer post about the impact Mike had on my life... he died in February of 2023 of pancreatic cancer and everytime I visit his site I get a little teary eyed...

The guy brought SO MUCH clarity to me regarding the Bible and some of the silly ideas I had about i growing up (and indeed MOST of the people in America that I have ever talked to about the Bible also have).

So this thought is a reminder to me to not forget to write more about him - Jesus touched so many people through Mike's ministry of studying the Bible for what it is, not what the arrogant Western mind wants it to be.
