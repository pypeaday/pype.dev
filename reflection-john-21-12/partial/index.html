<p>Jesus said to them, “Come, eat breakfast!” But none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” because they knew that it was the Lord.</p>

<p>Jesus offers this communion with himself every day, and to very believer...
Sharing a meal with someone is a pretty intimate thing (it's why hibachi with
strangers is awkward). Sitting around a table, especially where you'd be eating
with your hands, is a setting for family, or the family you choose (friends).</p>
<p>Jesus is the King of the universe, and he offers a seat at the table. I want
this to sit in my head without some unknown ethereal deep metaphorical
meaning... The simple truth is Jesus offers not only a place to sit next to
him, to enjoy his company and wisdom, but the contents of the table. At the
Last Supper he says he is the bread and cup, and after his resurrection he
invites his disciples to sit with him on the beach and eat breakfast here in
John 21. Every invitation to eat with him is to share the same meat, the wine,
the conversation with the Saints, and ultimately the prize of time with the
Lord.</p>
<p>Jesus is the <a href="/reflection-philippians-3-8/#gain">prize</a>, not what he can do.</p>
<p>I am hesitant to answer this call often... and it's because I'm often more
satisfied by drive-thru wings eaten alone in my office than I am around the
table with Jesus and his other disciples. But he still offers an invitation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Come, eat&quot;</p>

<p>His invitation strikes me as the choice following in Joshua 24:15:</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p>But if it is bad in your eyes to serve Yahweh, choose for yourselves today whom you want to serve, whether it is the gods that your ancestors served beyond the river, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living; but as for me and my household, we will serve Yahweh.”</p>
</div>
<p>Jesus' offer to come and dine is him presenting a choice... &quot;choose for
yourselves today whom you want to serve.... but as for me and my household, we
will serve Yahweh.&quot;</p>
<p>The choice is daily, and every reflection of mine comes back to this. Jesus
offers himself, his table, his righteousness, everything we need for godliness
and flourishing as creatures made in his image. And yet every day, face to face
with the reality of the world the choice is still yours and mine to make -
today, whom will you serve? Every day I have to say &quot;as for me and my house, we
will serve the Lord&quot;</p>
<p>May that be true today, and tomorrow but tomorrow has enough trouble of its
own, so today thank you Jesus for offering the table, to eat and drink
together. And by the grace of his calling, today I will say &quot;we will serve the
Lord.&quot;</p>
