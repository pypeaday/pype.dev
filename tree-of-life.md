content: "# Video\n\n## Eden\n\nBiblical story begins in a garden, which is presented
  as a type of Temple. The\ntop (center) is the Tree of Life, which represents God's
  life and creative\npower. Humans **were supposed to eat from the Tree of Life**
  but there's\nanother tree, the Tree of Knowledge of \"good\" and \"bad\" which represents\nassuming
  the authority to define good and bad for one's own life rather than\ntrusting God's
  defintion. Human eat of that tree and are thus exiled from the\ngarden.\n\n## Burning
  Bush\n\nMoses meets God at a burning tree, a plant on a mountain radiating with
  God's\npower just like the Tree of Life. Yahweh charges Moses to bring the same
  choice\nto the Israelites that Adam and Eve had, which is to trust God or define\nmorality
  for themselves.\n\n## Jesus\n\nJesus announced that God's eternal life is available
  through him now -\noriginally in Eden given through the Tree of Life. Jesus invites
  other people\nto \"eat of him\" to be transformed by God's own life. The invitation
  is the same\n- to trust Yahweh or not. But Jesus' life exposes humanity's brokenness
  in that\n    humans crucified him. Jesus is hung on a cross (a tree) on the top
  of a\n    hill (like Mt. Sinai) and humans not only eat of a different false tree
  of\n    life, but they chopped down the real Tree of Life - Jesus.\n\n# Questions\n\n!!!
  note \"1\"\n\n        What is one practical example of what it means to eat from
  the tree of\n        life? How is it different from eating from the false tree of
  life?\n\nGiving money away I think is one practical example of eating from the tree
  of\nlife. Jesus calls us to share our blessings, and choosing to live by his\nauthority
  rather than decide for myself what to do with my money (meaning to\nspend it on
  my desires only rather than invest in the Kingdom) then I make the\nsame choice
  humanity always makes - to not trust God's definition of good and\nbad\n\n!!! note
  \"2\"\n    \n    Compare John 15:5-13\n    with Matthew 7:15-20\n    . How does
  the true vine give life? How do we recognize a false tree of life?\n\n!!! scripture
  \"John 15:5-13\"\n\n    5I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me
  and I in him, he\n    bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing. 6If
  anyone does not\n    abide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up; and
  they gather\n    them, and cast them into the fire and they are burned. 7If you
  abide in Me,\n    and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will
  be done for\n    you. 8My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit,
  and so\n    prove to be My disciples. 9Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also\n
  \   loved you; abide in My love. 10If you keep My commandments, you will abide\n
  \   in My love; just as I have kept My Father\u2019s commandments and abide in His\n
  \   love. 11These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and\n
  \   that your joy may be made full. Disciples\u2019 Relation to Each Other 12\u201CThis\n
  \   is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you.\n    13Greater
  love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his\n    friends.\n\n\n!!!
  scripture \"Matthew 7:15-20\"\n\n    15\u201CBeware of the false prophets, who come
  to you in sheep\u2019s clothing, but\n    inwardly are ravenous wolves. 16You will
  know them by their fruits. Grapes\n    are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs
  from thistles, are they? 17So\n    every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad
  tree bears bad fruit. 18A\n    good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad
  tree produce good fruit.\n    19Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut
  down and thrown into the\n    fire. 20So then, you will know them by their fruits.\n\nThe
  true vine gives life through communion and connection. Jesus says to \"abide\nin
  [him]\" which is represented by a choice to believe him about kingdom, love,\nrelationships,
  brokenness, etc... By meditating on the Word of God, communing\nwith Jesus, being
  washed and guided by the Spirit we are transformed more and more into\nthe image
  of Jesus which is real and true life.\n\n!!! note \"3\"\n\n    What are some examples
  of good fruit and bad fruit (see Galatians 5:16-25)?\n\n!!! scripture \"Galations
  5:16-25\"\n\n    16But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the
  desire of\n    the flesh. 17For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and
  the\n    Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so\n
  \   that you may not do the things that you please. 18But if you are led by the\n
  \   Spirit, you are not under the Law. 19Now the deeds of the flesh are\n    evident,
  which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, 20idolatry, sorcery,\n    enmities,
  strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions,\n    factions, 21envying,
  drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of\n    which I forewarn you, just
  as I have forewarned you, that those who\n    practice such things will not inherit
  the kingdom of God. 22But the fruit\n    of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
  kindness, goodness,\n    faithfulness, 23gentleness, self-control; against such
  things there is no\n    law. 24Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified
  the flesh with\n    its passions and desires. 25If we live by the Spirit, let us
  also walk by\n    the Spirit.\n\nGood fruit:\n\n    - choosing to guard my eyes
  and thoughts against sexual immorality\n    - remaining calm when things aren't
  going my way at work\n    - drinking water instead of _another_ drink at night\n
  \   - giving money away out of love\n    - seeking unity and charity especially
  in any time of conflict\n\nBad fruit:\n\n    - outbursts at work - for me this is
  basically giving up hope for someone to be successful. By God's grace I have a desire
  to help peopl learn and succeed, but I can exhaust that desire and instead of prioritize
  an individual's well-being/growth I place my frustration above that and let my annoyance
  guide me more than a spirit of teaching and gentleness\n    - having that second,
  or third, drink \n\n> If you are led byt he Spirit, you are not under the Law...
  This isn't saying\n> that the Law doesn't apply, but that by the Spirit's guidance
  we will never\n> be found guilty by anything in the Law!\n\n!!! note \"4\"\n\n    When
  Jesus talks about what his death will accomplish, he talks about a\n    seed going
  into the ground before it bears fruit (see John 12:23-26). What\n    could it look
  like to live in the ways of Jesus and bear the fruit of life?\n\n!!! scripture \"John
  12:23-26\"\n\n\n    23And Jesus *answered them, saying, \u201CThe hour has come
  for the Son of Man\n    to be glorified. 24Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a
  grain of wheat\n    falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies,
  it bears\n    much fruit. 25He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his
  life in\n    this world will keep it to life eternal. 26If anyone serves Me, he
  must\n    follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also; if anyone serves\n
  \   Me, the Father will honor him.\n\nMeditating on God's faithfulness to humanity
  in spite of our disobedience I\nthink is an avenue by which the Spirit changes our
  hearts and as we are changed\nby him we live lives that reflect Jesus' own life\n\nI
  think there can be many facets to the seed dying aspect, one relevant piece\nseems
  fairly self-evident in the passage... if we hold onto our life (ie. be a\nseed that
  never dies) then we will never flourish, but if we give up the life\nwe have now
  and live like Jesus did, we will blessed with life"

    God's eternal life is available through him now -\noriginally in Eden given through
    the Tree of Life. Jesus invites other people\nto &quot;eat of him&quot; to be
    transformed by God's own life. The invitation is the same</p>\n<ul>\n<li>to trust
    Yahweh or not. But Jesus' life exposes humanity's brokenness in that\nhumans crucified
    him. Jesus is hung on a cross (a tree) on the top of a\nhill (like Mt. Sinai)
    and humans not only eat of a different false tree of\nlife, but they chopped down
    the real Tree of Life - Jesus.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"questions\">Questions <a

    note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">1</p>\n<pre><code>What is one practical
    example of what it means to eat from the tree of\nlife? How is it different from
    eating from the false tree of life?\n</code></pre>\n</div>\n<p>Giving money away
    I think is one practical example of eating from the tree of\nlife. Jesus calls
    us to share our blessings, and choosing to live by his\nauthority rather than
    decide for myself what to do with my money (meaning to\nspend it on my desires
    only rather than invest in the Kingdom) then I make the\nsame choice humanity
    always makes - to not trust God's definition of good and\nbad</p>\n<div class=\"admonition
    note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">2</p>\n<p>Compare John 15:5-13\nwith Matthew
    7:15-20\n. How does the true vine give life? How do we recognize a false tree
    of life?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">John
    15:5-13</p>\n<p>5I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and
    I in him, he\nbears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing. 6If anyone
    does not\nabide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up; and they gather\nthem,
    and cast them into the fire and they are burned. 7If you abide in Me,\nand My
    words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for\nyou. 8My Father
    is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, and so\nprove to be My disciples.
    9Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also\nloved you; abide in My love. 10If
    you keep My commandments, you will abide\nin My love; just as I have kept My Father\u2019s
    commandments and abide in His\nlove. 11These things I have spoken to you so that
    My joy may be in you, and\nthat your joy may be made full. Disciples\u2019 Relation
    to Each Other 12\u201CThis\nis My commandment, that you love one another, just
    as I have loved you.\n13Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his
    life for his\nfriends.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Matthew
    7:15-20</p>\n<p>15\u201CBeware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep\u2019s
    clothing, but\ninwardly are ravenous wolves. 16You will know them by their fruits.
    Grapes\nare not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they? 17So\nevery
    good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. 18A\ngood tree cannot
    produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.\n19Every tree that does
    not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the\nfire. 20So then, you will
    know them by their fruits.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The true vine gives life through communion
    and connection. Jesus says to &quot;abide\nin [him]&quot; which is represented
    by a choice to believe him about kingdom, love,\nrelationships, brokenness, etc...
    By meditating on the Word of God, communing\nwith Jesus, being washed and guided
    by the Spirit we are transformed more and more into\nthe image of Jesus which
    is real and true life.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">3</p>\n<p>What
    are some examples of good fruit and bad fruit (see Galatians 5:16-25)?</p>\n</div>\n<div
    class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Galations 5:16-25</p>\n<p>16But
    I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of\nthe flesh.
    17For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the\nSpirit against the
    flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so\nthat you may not do the
    things that you please. 18But if you are led by the\nSpirit, you are not under
    the Law. 19Now the deeds of the flesh are\nevident, which are: immorality, impurity,
    sensuality, 20idolatry, sorcery,\nenmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger,
    disputes, dissensions,\nfactions, 21envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things
    like these, of\nwhich I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those
    who\npractice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 22But the fruit\nof
    the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,\nfaithfulness, 23gentleness,
    self-control; against such things there is no\nlaw. 24Now those who belong to
    Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with\nits passions and desires. 25If we
    live by the Spirit, let us also walk by\nthe Spirit.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Good fruit:</p>\n<pre><code>-
    choosing to guard my eyes and thoughts against sexual immorality\n- remaining
    calm when things aren't going my way at work\n- drinking water instead of _another_
    drink at night\n- giving money away out of love\n- seeking unity and charity especially
    in any time of conflict\n</code></pre>\n<p>Bad fruit:</p>\n<pre><code>- outbursts
    at work - for me this is basically giving up hope for someone to be successful.
    By God's grace I have a desire to help peopl learn and succeed, but I can exhaust
    that desire and instead of prioritize an individual's well-being/growth I place
    my frustration above that and let my annoyance guide me more than a spirit of
    teaching and gentleness\n- having that second, or third, drink \n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If
    you are led byt he Spirit, you are not under the Law... This isn't saying\nthat
    the Law doesn't apply, but that by the Spirit's guidance we will never\nbe found
    guilty by anything in the Law!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">4</p>\n<p>When Jesus talks about what his death will
    accomplish, he talks about a\nseed going into the ground before it bears fruit
    (see John 12:23-26). What\ncould it look like to live in the ways of Jesus and
    bear the fruit of life?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">John 12:23-26</p>\n</div>\n<pre><code>23And Jesus *answered
    them, saying, \u201CThe hour has come for the Son of Man\nto be glorified. 24Truly,
    truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat\nfalls into the earth and dies, it
    remains alone; but if it dies, it bears\nmuch fruit. 25He who loves his life loses
    it, and he who hates his life in\nthis world will keep it to life eternal. 26If
    anyone serves Me, he must\nfollow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be
    also; if anyone serves\nMe, the Father will honor him.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Meditating
    on God's faithfulness to humanity in spite of our disobedience I\nthink is an
    avenue by which the Spirit changes our hearts and as we are changed\nby him we
    live lives that reflect Jesus' own life</p>\n<p>I think there can be many facets
    to the seed dying aspect, one relevant piece\nseems fairly self-evident in the
    passage... if we hold onto our life (ie. be a\nseed that never dies) then we will
    never flourish, but if we give up the life\nwe have now and live like Jesus did,
    we will blessed with life</p>\n\n    </section>\n</article>        </div>\n    </main>\n\n</div>\n

    does not\nabide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up; and they gather\nthem,
    and cast them into the fire and they are burned. 7If you abide in Me,\nand My
    words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for\nyou. 8My Father
    is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, and so\nprove to be My disciples.
    9Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also\nloved you; abide in My love. 10If
    you keep My commandments, you will abide\nin My love; just as I have kept My Father\u2019s

    By meditating on the Word of God, communing\nwith Jesus, being washed and guided
    by the Spirit we are transformed more and more into\nthe image of Jesus which
    is real and true life.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">3</p>\n<p>What
    are some examples of good fruit and bad fruit (see Galatians 5:16-25)?</p>\n</div>\n<div
    class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Galations 5:16-25</p>\n<p>16But
    I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of\nthe flesh.
    17For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the\nSpirit against the
    flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so\nthat you may not do the
    things that you please. 18But if you are led by the\nSpirit, you are not under
    the Law. 19Now the deeds of the flesh are\nevident, which are: immorality, impurity,
    sensuality, 20idolatry, sorcery,\nenmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger,
    disputes, dissensions,\nfactions, 21envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things
    like these, of\nwhich I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those
    who\npractice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 22But the fruit\nof
    the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,\nfaithfulness, 23gentleness,
    self-control; against such things there is no\nlaw. 24Now those who belong to
    Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with\nits passions and desires. 25If we
    live by the Spirit, let us also walk by\nthe Spirit.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Good fruit:</p>\n<pre><code>-
    choosing to guard my eyes and thoughts against sexual immorality\n- remaining
    calm when things aren't going my way at work\n- drinking water instead of _another_
    drink at night\n- giving money away out of love\n- seeking unity and charity especially
    in any time of conflict\n</code></pre>\n<p>Bad fruit:</p>\n<pre><code>- outbursts
    at work - for me this is basically giving up hope for someone to be successful.
    By God's grace I have a desire to help peopl learn and succeed, but I can exhaust
    that desire and instead of prioritize an individual's well-being/growth I place
    my frustration above that and let my annoyance guide me more than a spirit of
    teaching and gentleness\n- having that second, or third, drink \n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If
    you are led byt he Spirit, you are not under the Law... This isn't saying\nthat
    the Law doesn't apply, but that by the Spirit's guidance we will never\nbe found
    guilty by anything in the Law!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">4</p>\n<p>When Jesus talks about what his death will
    accomplish, he talks about a\nseed going into the ground before it bears fruit
    (see John 12:23-26). What\ncould it look like to live in the ways of Jesus and
    bear the fruit of life?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">John 12:23-26</p>\n</div>\n<pre><code>23And Jesus *answered
    them, saying, \u201CThe hour has come for the Son of Man\nto be glorified. 24Truly,
    truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat\nfalls into the earth and dies, it
    remains alone; but if it dies, it bears\nmuch fruit. 25He who loves his life loses
    it, and he who hates his life in\nthis world will keep it to life eternal. 26If
    anyone serves Me, he must\nfollow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be
    also; if anyone serves\nMe, the Father will honor him.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Meditating
    on God's faithfulness to humanity in spite of our disobedience I\nthink is an
    avenue by which the Spirit changes our hearts and as we are changed\nby him we
    live lives that reflect Jesus' own life</p>\n<p>I think there can be many facets
    to the seed dying aspect, one relevant piece\nseems fairly self-evident in the
    passage... if we hold onto our life (ie. be a\nseed that never dies) then we will
    never flourish, but if we give up the life\nwe have now and live like Jesus did,
    we will blessed with life</p>\n\n    </section>\n</article>"

## Eden

Biblical story begins in a garden, which is presented as a type of Temple. The
top (center) is the Tree of Life, which represents God's life and creative
power. Humans **were supposed to eat from the Tree of Life** but there's
another tree, the Tree of Knowledge of "good" and "bad" which represents
assuming the authority to define good and bad for one's own life rather than
trusting God's defintion. Human eat of that tree and are thus exiled from the
garden.

## Burning Bush

Moses meets God at a burning tree, a plant on a mountain radiating with God's
power just like the Tree of Life. Yahweh charges Moses to bring the same choice
to the Israelites that Adam and Eve had, which is to trust God or define
morality for themselves.

## Jesus

Jesus announced that God's eternal life is available through him now -
originally in Eden given through the Tree of Life. Jesus invites other people
to "eat of him" to be transformed by God's own life. The invitation is the same
- to trust Yahweh or not. But Jesus' life exposes humanity's brokenness in that
    humans crucified him. Jesus is hung on a cross (a tree) on the top of a
    hill (like Mt. Sinai) and humans not only eat of a different false tree of
    life, but they chopped down the real Tree of Life - Jesus.

# Questions

!!! note "1"

        What is one practical example of what it means to eat from the tree of
        life? How is it different from eating from the false tree of life?

Giving money away I think is one practical example of eating from the tree of
life. Jesus calls us to share our blessings, and choosing to live by his
authority rather than decide for myself what to do with my money (meaning to
spend it on my desires only rather than invest in the Kingdom) then I make the
same choice humanity always makes - to not trust God's definition of good and
bad

!!! note "2"
    
    Compare John 15:5-13
    with Matthew 7:15-20
    . How does the true vine give life? How do we recognize a false tree of life?

!!! scripture "John 15:5-13"

    5I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he
    bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing. 6If anyone does not
    abide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up; and they gather
    them, and cast them into the fire and they are burned. 7If you abide in Me,
    and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for
    you. 8My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, and so
    prove to be My disciples. 9Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also
    loved you; abide in My love. 10If you keep My commandments, you will abide
    in My love; just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His
    love. 11These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and
    that your joy may be made full. Disciples’ Relation to Each Other 12“This
    is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you.
    13Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his
    friends.


!!! scripture "Matthew 7:15-20"

    15“Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but
    inwardly are ravenous wolves. 16You will know them by their fruits. Grapes
    are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they? 17So
    every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. 18A
    good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
    19Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the
    fire. 20So then, you will know them by their fruits.

The true vine gives life through communion and connection. Jesus says to "abide
in [him]" which is represented by a choice to believe him about kingdom, love,
relationships, brokenness, etc... By meditating on the Word of God, communing
with Jesus, being washed and guided by the Spirit we are transformed more and more into
the image of Jesus which is real and true life.

!!! note "3"

    What are some examples of good fruit and bad fruit (see Galatians 5:16-25)?

!!! scripture "Galations 5:16-25"

    16But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of
    the flesh. 17For the flesh sets its desire against the Spirit, and the
    Spirit against the flesh; for these are in opposition to one another, so
    that you may not do the things that you please. 18But if you are led by the
    Spirit, you are not under the Law. 19Now the deeds of the flesh are
    evident, which are: immorality, impurity, sensuality, 20idolatry, sorcery,
    enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions,
    factions, 21envying, drunkenness, carousing, and things like these, of
    which I forewarn you, just as I have forewarned you, that those who
    practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. 22But the fruit
    of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
    faithfulness, 23gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no
    law. 24Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with
    its passions and desires. 25If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by
    the Spirit.

Good fruit:

    - choosing to guard my eyes and thoughts against sexual immorality
    - remaining calm when things aren't going my way at work
    - drinking water instead of _another_ drink at night
    - giving money away out of love
    - seeking unity and charity especially in any time of conflict

    - outbursts at work - for me this is basically giving up hope for someone to be successful. By God's grace I have a desire to help peopl learn and succeed, but I can exhaust that desire and instead of prioritize an individual's well-being/growth I place my frustration above that and let my annoyance guide me more than a spirit of teaching and gentleness

!!! note "4"

    When Jesus talks about what his death will accomplish, he talks about a
    seed going into the ground before it bears fruit (see John 12:23-26). What
    could it look like to live in the ways of Jesus and bear the fruit of life?

!!! scripture "John 12:23-26"


    23And Jesus *answered them, saying, “The hour has come for the Son of Man
    to be glorified. 24Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat
    falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears
    much fruit. 25He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in
    this world will keep it to life eternal. 26If anyone serves Me, he must
    follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also; if anyone serves
    Me, the Father will honor him.

Meditating on God's faithfulness to humanity in spite of our disobedience I
think is an avenue by which the Spirit changes our hearts and as we are changed
by him we live lives that reflect Jesus' own life

I think there can be many facets to the seed dying aspect, one relevant piece
seems fairly self-evident in the passage... if we hold onto our life (ie. be a
seed that never dies) then we will never flourish, but if we give up the life
we have now and live like Jesus did, we will blessed with life
