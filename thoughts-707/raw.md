more cuts for the sake of AI investment... this is getting out of hand. I'm thankful that I don't work in a field that will be overtaken by AI in the sense of losing my job (I mean we're like 47 months into AI will end dev jobs tomorrow) - of course I have to learn about the tools and LLMs have increased my output in many ways. If I was fearful of losing my job, for example being in Sales at Microsoft, I would be using every on-the-clock hour to find a new job...
