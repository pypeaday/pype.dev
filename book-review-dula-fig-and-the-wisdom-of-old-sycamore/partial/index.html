            <p>Dula, Fig, and the Wisdom of Old Sycamore is a beautifully illustrated and
powerful story that gives kids an accessible framework to better understand their
world - hard things are easier with kindness. Old Sycamore helps young Dula
understand herself a little better through commentary on her mother's favorite
story (for which Dula was named). He tends to Dula's frustration in a loving
way and dismisses her back to her real life with gentleness. Kindness is a
core-value of our household, and I loved sharing this story with
my kids. I look forward to reading it many times over the next several years!</p>
