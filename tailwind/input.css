  You can add custom base styles here if needed.
  For example, to apply a default font if not overridden by Tailwind utilities:
*/
/*
body {
    @apply font-inter;
}
*/

/*
  If you have existing styles in static/app.css or static/post.css
  that you want to keep and are NOT covered by Tailwind utilities or
  your theme in tailwind.config.js, you can @import them here.
  However, the goal is to eventually replace most of them with Tailwind.

  Example:
  @import "custom-base.css";
