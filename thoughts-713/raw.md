Here's my thought on <a href="https://www.copilotinstructions.xyz/">ðŸ’­ Copilot Instructions</a>

---

I have tried a few different cursorrules/windsurfrules with windsurf, but I didn't even know you could give copilot custom instructions. I see python + fastapi on here, which I build with frequently at home, so I'll look forward to seeing if the results are any better with a custom prompt using copilot
