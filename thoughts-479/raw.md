Here's my thought on <a href="https://www.audiobookshelf.org/">ðŸ’­ audiobookshelf</a>

Audiobookshelf looks like a solid competitor for booksonic. I've liked the simple subsonic api driven nature of booksonic but my wife would like some more appropriate and easy-to-use organization... booksonic is not a great "library"... I'm looking forward to putting this into my homelab soon
