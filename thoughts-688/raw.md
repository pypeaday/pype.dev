Here's my thought on <a href="https://slashpages.net/">ðŸ’­ slash pages</a>

Waylon's mentioned slash pages before, but as I work on building my blog again and writing more regularly thanks to "thoughts" etc. I'd like to start putting together some meaningful slash pages for myself... I'm not sure what to put out there yet but this thought can serve as a todo for me

     This is one of [[ my-thoughts ]]. I picked this up from [Waylon Walker](https://waylonwalker.com)(https://thoughts.waylonwalker.com). It's a short note that I make about someone else's
     content online.  Learn more about the process [[ thoughts ]]
