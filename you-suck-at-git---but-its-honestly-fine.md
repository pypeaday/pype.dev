content: "## Git is for everyone\n\nI just started listening to [localfirst.fm podcast](https://www.localfirst.fm/)\npodcast
  and would recommend it after 2 episodes. In the first episode, the\nhosts discuss
  where the term `localfirst` comes from, what it means, and\nexamples of some localfirst,
  or semi-localfirst projects. One of them is `git`\n\n- the de-facto standard by
  which developers share code today.\n\nThere's a reason it's the standard. I'm not
  arguing that it's perfect, and\nthere's new abstractions that may help people adopt
  usage like\n[jujutsu](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj), but ultimately `git` is a great
  tool,\nand anyone can use it who works with text files (lookin at you book-writing\nnerds)\n\nBut
  as I was enjoying the pod the co-host/guest said \"and we all know the git user\nexperience
  isn't that great\"\n\n!!! danger \"heavy sigh\"\n\n    Git isn't that hard - you
  probably just aren't that good at it\n\n## It's OK\n\nDon't hear me say that you
  suck at git like that's a bad thing... It's _totally\nfine_ to not be a wizard.
  Many people can use git like 80-90% efficiently for\ntheir own use cases. In fact,
  my usage of git doesn't fall into any perfectly\nestablished patterns, and the decisions
  I make are not always the same (the\noverplayed rebase vs merge-upstream argument...
  I do both, it doesn't matter,\nsquash your crap at the end anyways...)\n\nSo continue
  to collaborate - checkout your feature branches, pull in\n`origin/main` after a
  PR, ask for help with a rebase for the 69th time if you\nneed to\n\n!!! danger \"\"\n\n
  \   But quit your stupid annoying bitching\n\n## Seriously\n\nHonestly, I learned
  _about_ git 8 years ago when I started my first job as a\ndata scientist. I was
  told by another developer, Jokko,\nthat it was the standard for collaboration...
  only issue was that almost no one\nin our division even used it. Or if they did
  it was at the end of a project,\nafter sharing code on share drives and OneDrive,
  at the very end we'd see `git\ninit`, `git add .`, `git commit -m \"pushed to git\"`,
  `git push`... literally 0\nvalue, or at least no more value than\n`my_project_final_FINAL_v2_project-over-now.zip`\n\nIt
  took me a few weeks of on-the-job git usage, practicing way over complicated\ngit
  flows and talking about git with the few people around me who knew it, for\nme to
  become a go-to resource... I was and am honestly still annoyed about\nit... It didn't
  take that long, or that much effort, to get pretty comfortable\nwith git. There's
  tons of UIs (with their own flaws), TUIs, and resources for\nlearning the few things
  that will make you stand out as a git wizard:\n\n1. can you rebase onto a new root
  commit?\n2. can you pull in changes from someone else's feature branch?\n3. if you
  find yourself in `detached HEAD state` are you panicked?\n\nJust make a directory,
  `git init`, and start shitting all over text files...\nmake branches, reconcile
  differences, just freaking practice for 10 minutes\n\n## End\n\nI was triggered
  I guess listening to this podcast episode... It's fine to not\nbe an expert, it's
  fine to just use the 3 or 4 commands you probably need (`git\ncheckout -b, rebase
  origin/main, merge feature/branch, push`), I am happy to\nhelp people with git everyday
  - like I said above, I am somehow a go-to\nresource for git in my workplace....
  (heck, even one of my managers asks me to\nsquash all the commits on his feature
  branches for him before it's merged to\nmain... it's fine)\n\nBut the user experience
  isn't bad, so quit your bitching.\n\n---\n\n??? note \"phone notes\"\n\n    hot
  take, if you complain about git then you don't it... and that's fine but\n    shut
  up. I love git,I use it in a way that's productive for me, and when I hear\n    people
  complain all they ever say is \"git is hard\" and \"why is rebasing so\n    hard?!?!\"\n
  \   but they don't get it, and that's fine. you can use git inefficiently, as a\n
  \   requirement of your job, and not enjoy it. but don't bitch, because with 10\n
  \   minutes of practice you could gain some real fluency in rebasing"

    would recommend it after 2 episodes. In the first episode, the\nhosts discuss
    where the term <code>localfirst</code> comes from, what it means, and\nexamples
    of some localfirst, or semi-localfirst projects. One of them is <code>git</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>the
    de-facto standard by which developers share code today.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There's
    a reason it's the standard. I'm not arguing that it's perfect, and\nthere's new
    abstractions that may help people adopt usage like\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj\">jujutsu</a>,
    but ultimately <code>git</code> is a great tool,\nand anyone can use it who works
    with text files (lookin at you book-writing\nnerds)</p>\n<p>But as I was enjoying

    <em>about</em> git 8 years ago when I started my first job as a\ndata scientist.
    I was told by another developer, Jokko,\nthat it was the standard for collaboration...
    only issue was that almost no one\nin our division even used it. Or if they did
    it was at the end of a project,\nafter sharing code on share drives and OneDrive,
    at the very end we'd see <code>git init</code>, <code>git add .</code>, <code>git
    commit -m &quot;pushed to git&quot;</code>, <code>git push</code>... literally
    0\nvalue, or at least no more value than\n<code>my_project_final_FINAL_v2_project-over-now.zip</code></p>\n<p>It
    took me a few weeks of on-the-job git usage, practicing way over complicated\ngit
    flows and talking about git with the few people around me who knew it, for\nme
    to become a go-to resource... I was and am honestly still annoyed about\nit...
    It didn't take that long, or that much effort, to get pretty comfortable\nwith
    git. There's tons of UIs (with their own flaws), TUIs, and resources for\nlearning
    the few things that will make you stand out as a git wizard:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>can
    you rebase onto a new root commit?</li>\n<li>can you pull in changes from someone
    else's feature branch?</li>\n<li>if you find yourself in <code>detached HEAD state</code>
    are you panicked?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Just make a directory, <code>git init</code>,
    and start shitting all over text files...\nmake branches, reconcile differences,
    just freaking practice for 10 minutes</p>\n<h2 id=\"end\">End <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    listening to this podcast episode... It's fine to not\nbe an expert, it's fine
    to just use the 3 or 4 commands you probably need (<code>git checkout -b, rebase
    origin/main, merge feature/branch, push</code>), I am happy to\nhelp people with
    git everyday - like I said above, I am somehow a go-to\nresource for git in my
    workplace.... (heck, even one of my managers asks me to\nsquash all the commits
    on his feature branches for him before it's merged to\nmain... it's fine)</p>\n<p>But
    the user experience isn't bad, so quit your bitching.</p>\n<hr />\n<div class=\"admonition
    note is-collapsible collapsible-closed\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">phone
    notes</p>\n<p>hot take, if you complain about git then you don't it... and that's
    fine but\nshut up. I love git,I use it in a way that's productive for me, and
    when I hear\npeople complain all they ever say is &quot;git is hard&quot; and
    &quot;why is rebasing so\nhard?!?!&quot;\nbut they don't get it, and that's fine.
    you can use git inefficiently, as a\nrequirement of your job, and not enjoy it.
    but don't bitch, because with 10\nminutes of practice you could gain some real
    fluency in rebasing</p>\n</div>\n\n    </section>\n</article>        </div>\n

    you suck at git like that's a bad thing... It's <em>totally\nfine</em> to not
    be a wizard. Many people can use git like 80-90% efficiently for\ntheir own use
    cases. In fact, my usage of git doesn't fall into any perfectly\nestablished patterns,
    and the decisions I make are not always the same (the\noverplayed rebase vs merge-upstream
    argument... I do both, it doesn't matter,\nsquash your crap at the end anyways...)</p>\n<p>So
    continue to collaborate - checkout your feature branches, pull in\n<code>origin/main</code>
    after a PR, ask for help with a rebase for the 69th time if you\nneed to</p>\n<div

    <em>about</em> git 8 years ago when I started my first job as a\ndata scientist.
    I was told by another developer, Jokko,\nthat it was the standard for collaboration...
    only issue was that almost no one\nin our division even used it. Or if they did
    it was at the end of a project,\nafter sharing code on share drives and OneDrive,
    at the very end we'd see <code>git init</code>, <code>git add .</code>, <code>git
    commit -m &quot;pushed to git&quot;</code>, <code>git push</code>... literally
    0\nvalue, or at least no more value than\n<code>my_project_final_FINAL_v2_project-over-now.zip</code></p>\n<p>It
    took me a few weeks of on-the-job git usage, practicing way over complicated\ngit
    flows and talking about git with the few people around me who knew it, for\nme
    to become a go-to resource... I was and am honestly still annoyed about\nit...
    It didn't take that long, or that much effort, to get pretty comfortable\nwith
    git. There's tons of UIs (with their own flaws), TUIs, and resources for\nlearning
    the few things that will make you stand out as a git wizard:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>can
    you rebase onto a new root commit?</li>\n<li>can you pull in changes from someone
    else's feature branch?</li>\n<li>if you find yourself in <code>detached HEAD state</code>
    are you panicked?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Just make a directory, <code>git init</code>,
    and start shitting all over text files...\nmake branches, reconcile differences,
    just freaking practice for 10 minutes</p>\n<h2 id=\"end\">End <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    a reason it's the standard. I'm not arguing that it's perfect, and\nthere's new
    abstractions that may help people adopt usage like\n<a href=\"https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj\">jujutsu</a>,
    but ultimately <code>git</code> is a great tool,\nand anyone can use it who works
    with text files (lookin at you book-writing\nnerds)</p>\n<p>But as I was enjoying

    <em>about</em> git 8 years ago when I started my first job as a\ndata scientist.
    I was told by another developer, Jokko,\nthat it was the standard for collaboration...
    only issue was that almost no one\nin our division even used it. Or if they did
    it was at the end of a project,\nafter sharing code on share drives and OneDrive,
    at the very end we'd see <code>git init</code>, <code>git add .</code>, <code>git
    commit -m &quot;pushed to git&quot;</code>, <code>git push</code>... literally
    0\nvalue, or at least no more value than\n<code>my_project_final_FINAL_v2_project-over-now.zip</code></p>\n<p>It
    took me a few weeks of on-the-job git usage, practicing way over complicated\ngit
    flows and talking about git with the few people around me who knew it, for\nme
    to become a go-to resource... I was and am honestly still annoyed about\nit...
    It didn't take that long, or that much effort, to get pretty comfortable\nwith
    git. There's tons of UIs (with their own flaws), TUIs, and resources for\nlearning
    the few things that will make you stand out as a git wizard:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>can
    you rebase onto a new root commit?</li>\n<li>can you pull in changes from someone
    else's feature branch?</li>\n<li>if you find yourself in <code>detached HEAD state</code>
    are you panicked?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Just make a directory, <code>git init</code>,
    and start shitting all over text files...\nmake branches, reconcile differences,
    just freaking practice for 10 minutes</p>\n<h2 id=\"end\">End <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    when I hear\npeople complain all they ever say is &quot;git is hard&quot; and
    &quot;why is rebasing so\nhard?!?!&quot;\nbut they don't get it, and that's fine.
    you can use git inefficiently, as a\nrequirement of your job, and not enjoy it.

## Git is for everyone

I just started listening to [localfirst.fm podcast](https://www.localfirst.fm/)
podcast and would recommend it after 2 episodes. In the first episode, the
hosts discuss where the term `localfirst` comes from, what it means, and
examples of some localfirst, or semi-localfirst projects. One of them is `git`

- the de-facto standard by which developers share code today.

There's a reason it's the standard. I'm not arguing that it's perfect, and
there's new abstractions that may help people adopt usage like
[jujutsu](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj), but ultimately `git` is a great tool,
and anyone can use it who works with text files (lookin at you book-writing
nerds)

But as I was enjoying the pod the co-host/guest said "and we all know the git user
experience isn't that great"

!!! danger "heavy sigh"

    Git isn't that hard - you probably just aren't that good at it

## It's OK

Don't hear me say that you suck at git like that's a bad thing... It's _totally
fine_ to not be a wizard. Many people can use git like 80-90% efficiently for
their own use cases. In fact, my usage of git doesn't fall into any perfectly
established patterns, and the decisions I make are not always the same (the
overplayed rebase vs merge-upstream argument... I do both, it doesn't matter,
squash your crap at the end anyways...)

So continue to collaborate - checkout your feature branches, pull in
`origin/main` after a PR, ask for help with a rebase for the 69th time if you
need to

!!! danger ""

    But quit your stupid annoying bitching

## Seriously

    hot take, if you complain about git then you don't it... and that's fine but
    shut up. I love git,I use it in a way that's productive for me, and when I hear
    people complain all they ever say is "git is hard" and "why is rebasing so
    hard?!?!"
    but they don't get it, and that's fine. you can use git inefficiently, as a
