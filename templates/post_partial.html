          The 'prose' classes are from the @tailwindcss/typography plugin.
          If you're not using it, replace with your own class and add styles
          to static/post.css for h1, p, ul, code, blockquote etc. inside articles.
          'lg:prose-xl' makes the typography a bit larger on large screens.
          'dark:prose-invert' handles dark mode for typography.
          'max-w-none' removes the default max-width from prose if you want your article to span wider.
