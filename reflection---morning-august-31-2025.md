  51:5\n\n!!! note \"Spurgeon: Morning and Evening\"\n\n    In seasons of severe trial,
  the Christian has nothing on earth that he can\n    trust to, and is therefore compelled
  to cast himself on his God alone. When his\n    vessel is on its beam-ends, and
  no human deliverance can avail, he must simply\n    and entirely trust himself to
  the providence and care of God. Happy storm that\n    wrecks a man on such a rock
  as this! O blessed hurricane that drives the soul\n    to God and God alone! There
  is no getting at our God sometimes because of the\n    multitude of our friends;
  but when a man is so poor, so friendless, so helpless\n    that he has nowhere else
  to turn, he flies into his Father\u2019s arms, and is\n    blessedly clasped therein!
  When he is burdened with troubles so pressing and so\n    peculiar, that he cannot
  tell them to any but his God, he may be thankful for\n    them; for he will learn
  more of his Lord then than at any other time. Oh,\n    tempest-tossed believer,
  it is a happy trouble that drives thee to thy Father!\n    Now that thou hast only
  thy God to trust to, see that thou puttest thy full\n    confidence in him. Dishonour
  not thy Lord and Master by unworthy doubts and\n    fears; but be strong in faith,
  giving glory to God. Show the world that thy God\n    is worth ten thousand worlds
  to thee. Show rich men how rich thou art in thy\n    poverty when the Lord God is
  thy helper. Show the strong man how strong thou\n    art in thy weakness when underneath
  thee are the everlasting arms. Now is the\n    time for feats of faith and valiant
  exploits. Be strong and very courageous,\n    and the Lord thy God shall certainly,
  as surely as he built the heavens and the\n    earth, glorify himself in thy weakness,
  and magnify his might in the midst of\n    thy distress. The grandeur of the arch
  of heaven would be spoiled if the sky\n    were supported by a single visible column,
  and your faith would lose its glory\n    if it rested on anything discernible by
  the carnal eye. May the Holy Spirit\n    give you to rest in Jesus this closing
  day of the month.\n\n    Spurgeon, C. H. (1896). Morning and evening: Daily readings.
  Passmore & Alabaster.\n\n## Reflection\n\nBy God's grace, I was led this morning
  through my old Logos dashboard to the evening and morning or the morning and reading
  daily readings from Charles Spurgeon.\nAnd today, August 31, the morning reading
  is\n\n!!! note \"Isaiah 51:5\" \n\n    \"on mine arm, shall they trust.\n\nAnd it's
  a short few words, but Spurgeon writes quite a bit about it.\nAnd there's many quotes
  from this short morning reflection that are very relevant to me in light of my work
  situation.\nOne of the things there I've been processing the most is the powerlessness
  I feel in regards to corporate policy and the control\nthat my employer wants to
  exercise over my life.\nBut the other side of that coin of control is me and me
  placing my trust in my employer to provide security for me.\nAnd God has been very
  good to me and still has given me security outside of my primary job.\nBut I did
  trust that job.\nAnd it's in the wake of losing it.\nI'm not even stretched that
  thin in losing my job.\nBut in the stretching that is taking place, Spurgeon says
  some things about God that I should impress into my heart.\n\n> Oh, blessed hurricane
  that drives the soul to God and God alone.\n\nShould we not consider trials - Joy?\nI'm
  sure not acting that joyful.\nBut God has been very sweet to me through these reflections,
  through drawing my eye and soul to him through the lens of trust.\n\n> There is
  no getting at our God sometimes because of the multitude of our friends. But when
  a man is so poor, so friendless, so helpless that he has nowhere else to turn, he
  flies into his father's arms and is blessedly clasped therein.\n\nSpurgeon clearly
  isn't saying we can't have friends here.\nI think what he is saying is \"the multitude
  of our {idols}\", really.\nLike Job's friends, maybe, the ones who keep our attention
  on work and the world and money and my 401k and the future.\nThose things are my
  \"__friends__\" because those things give me security.\nAnd maybe I have trusted
  too much, and now God is drawing me closer to him.\nAnd may I say, blessed be the
  name of the Lord who gives and takes away.\nO blessed hurricane that drives the
  soul to God and God alone.\nAmen."

    they trust.&quot;\n\u2014Isaiah 51:5</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Spurgeon: Morning and Evening</p>\n<p>In seasons of
    severe trial, the Christian has nothing on earth that he can\ntrust to, and is
    therefore compelled to cast himself on his God alone. When his\nvessel is on its
    beam-ends, and no human deliverance can avail, he must simply\nand entirely trust
    himself to the providence and care of God. Happy storm that\nwrecks a man on such
    a rock as this! O blessed hurricane that drives the soul\nto God and God alone!
    There is no getting at our God sometimes because of the\nmultitude of our friends;
    but when a man is so poor, so friendless, so helpless\nthat he has nowhere else
    to turn, he flies into his Father\u2019s arms, and is\nblessedly clasped therein!
    When he is burdened with troubles so pressing and so\npeculiar, that he cannot
    tell them to any but his God, he may be thankful for\nthem; for he will learn
    more of his Lord then than at any other time. Oh,\ntempest-tossed believer, it
    is a happy trouble that drives thee to thy Father!\nNow that thou hast only thy
    God to trust to, see that thou puttest thy full\nconfidence in him. Dishonour
    not thy Lord and Master by unworthy doubts and\nfears; but be strong in faith,
    giving glory to God. Show the world that thy God\nis worth ten thousand worlds
    to thee. Show rich men how rich thou art in thy\npoverty when the Lord God is
    thy helper. Show the strong man how strong thou\nart in thy weakness when underneath
    thee are the everlasting arms. Now is the\ntime for feats of faith and valiant
    exploits. Be strong and very courageous,\nand the Lord thy God shall certainly,
    as surely as he built the heavens and the\nearth, glorify himself in thy weakness,
    and magnify his might in the midst of\nthy distress. The grandeur of the arch
    of heaven would be spoiled if the sky\nwere supported by a single visible column,
    and your faith would lose its glory\nif it rested on anything discernible by the
    carnal eye. May the Holy Spirit\ngive you to rest in Jesus this closing day of
    the month.</p>\n<p>Spurgeon, C. H. (1896). Morning and evening: Daily readings.

    led this morning through my old Logos dashboard to the evening and morning or
    the morning and reading daily readings from Charles Spurgeon.\nAnd today, August
    31, the morning reading is</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Isaiah
    51:5</p>\n<p>&quot;on mine arm, shall they trust.</p>\n</div>\n<p>And it's a short
    few words, but Spurgeon writes quite a bit about it.\nAnd there's many quotes
    from this short morning reflection that are very relevant to me in light of my
    work situation.\nOne of the things there I've been processing the most is the
    powerlessness I feel in regards to corporate policy and the control\nthat my employer
    wants to exercise over my life.\nBut the other side of that coin of control is
    me and me placing my trust in my employer to provide security for me.\nAnd God
    has been very good to me and still has given me security outside of my primary
    job.\nBut I did trust that job.\nAnd it's in the wake of losing it.\nI'm not even
    stretched that thin in losing my job.\nBut in the stretching that is taking place,
    Spurgeon says some things about God that I should impress into my heart.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oh,
    blessed hurricane that drives the soul to God and God alone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Should
    we not consider trials - Joy?\nI'm sure not acting that joyful.\nBut God has been
    very sweet to me through these reflections, through drawing my eye and soul to
    him through the lens of trust.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is no getting at our
    God sometimes because of the multitude of our friends. But when a man is so poor,
    so friendless, so helpless that he has nowhere else to turn, he flies into his
    father's arms and is blessedly clasped therein.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Spurgeon
    clearly isn't saying we can't have friends here.\nI think what he is saying is
    &quot;the multitude of our {idols}&quot;, really.\nLike Job's friends, maybe,
    the ones who keep our attention on work and the world and money and my 401k and
    the future.\nThose things are my &quot;<strong>friends</strong>&quot; because
    those things give me security.\nAnd maybe I have trusted too much, and now God
    is drawing me closer to him.\nAnd may I say, blessed be the name of the Lord who
    gives and takes away.\nO blessed hurricane that drives the soul to God and God
    alone.\nAmen.</p>\n\n    </section>\n</article>        </div>\n    </main>\n\n</div>\n

    class=\"admonition-title\">Spurgeon: Morning and Evening</p>\n<p>In seasons of
    severe trial, the Christian has nothing on earth that he can\ntrust to, and is
    therefore compelled to cast himself on his God alone. When his\nvessel is on its
    beam-ends, and no human deliverance can avail, he must simply\nand entirely trust
    himself to the providence and care of God. Happy storm that\nwrecks a man on such
    a rock as this! O blessed hurricane that drives the soul\nto God and God alone!
    There is no getting at our God sometimes because of the\nmultitude of our friends;
    but when a man is so poor, so friendless, so helpless\nthat he has nowhere else
    to turn, he flies into his Father\u2019s arms, and is\nblessedly clasped therein!
    When he is burdened with troubles so pressing and so\npeculiar, that he cannot
    tell them to any but his God, he may be thankful for\nthem; for he will learn
    more of his Lord then than at any other time. Oh,\ntempest-tossed believer, it
    is a happy trouble that drives thee to thy Father!\nNow that thou hast only thy
    God to trust to, see that thou puttest thy full\nconfidence in him. Dishonour
    not thy Lord and Master by unworthy doubts and\nfears; but be strong in faith,
    giving glory to God. Show the world that thy God\nis worth ten thousand worlds
    to thee. Show rich men how rich thou art in thy\npoverty when the Lord God is
    thy helper. Show the strong man how strong thou\nart in thy weakness when underneath
    thee are the everlasting arms. Now is the\ntime for feats of faith and valiant
    exploits. Be strong and very courageous,\nand the Lord thy God shall certainly,
    as surely as he built the heavens and the\nearth, glorify himself in thy weakness,
    and magnify his might in the midst of\nthy distress. The grandeur of the arch
    of heaven would be spoiled if the sky\nwere supported by a single visible column,
    and your faith would lose its glory\nif it rested on anything discernible by the
    carnal eye. May the Holy Spirit\ngive you to rest in Jesus this closing day of
    the month.</p>\n<p>Spurgeon, C. H. (1896). Morning and evening: Daily readings.

    led this morning through my old Logos dashboard to the evening and morning or
    the morning and reading daily readings from Charles Spurgeon.\nAnd today, August
    31, the morning reading is</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Isaiah
    51:5</p>\n<p>&quot;on mine arm, shall they trust.</p>\n</div>\n<p>And it's a short
    few words, but Spurgeon writes quite a bit about it.\nAnd there's many quotes
    from this short morning reflection that are very relevant to me in light of my
    work situation.\nOne of the things there I've been processing the most is the
    powerlessness I feel in regards to corporate policy and the control\nthat my employer
    wants to exercise over my life.\nBut the other side of that coin of control is
    me and me placing my trust in my employer to provide security for me.\nAnd God
    has been very good to me and still has given me security outside of my primary
    job.\nBut I did trust that job.\nAnd it's in the wake of losing it.\nI'm not even
    stretched that thin in losing my job.\nBut in the stretching that is taking place,
    Spurgeon says some things about God that I should impress into my heart.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Oh,
    blessed hurricane that drives the soul to God and God alone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Should
    we not consider trials - Joy?\nI'm sure not acting that joyful.\nBut God has been
    very sweet to me through these reflections, through drawing my eye and soul to
    him through the lens of trust.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is no getting at our
    God sometimes because of the multitude of our friends. But when a man is so poor,
    so friendless, so helpless that he has nowhere else to turn, he flies into his
    father's arms and is blessedly clasped therein.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Spurgeon
    clearly isn't saying we can't have friends here.\nI think what he is saying is
    &quot;the multitude of our {idols}&quot;, really.\nLike Job's friends, maybe,
    the ones who keep our attention on work and the world and money and my 401k and
    the future.\nThose things are my &quot;<strong>friends</strong>&quot; because
    those things give me security.\nAnd maybe I have trusted too much, and now God
    is drawing me closer to him.\nAnd may I say, blessed be the name of the Lord who
    gives and takes away.\nO blessed hurricane that drives the soul to God and God
    alone.\nAmen.</p>\n\n    </section>\n</article>"

    class=\"admonition-title\">Spurgeon: Morning and Evening</p>\n<p>In seasons of
    severe trial, the Christian has nothing on earth that he can\ntrust to, and is
    therefore compelled to cast himself on his God alone. When his\nvessel is on its
    beam-ends, and no human deliverance can avail, he must simply\nand entirely trust
    himself to the providence and care of God. Happy storm that\nwrecks a man on such
    a rock as this! O blessed hurricane that drives the soul\nto God and God alone!
    There is no getting at our God sometimes because of the\nmultitude of our friends;
    but when a man is so poor, so friendless, so helpless\nthat he has nowhere else
    to turn, he flies into his Father\u2019s arms, and is\nblessedly clasped therein!
    When he is burdened with troubles so pressing and so\npeculiar, that he cannot
    tell them to any but his God, he may be thankful for\nthem; for he will learn
    more of his Lord then than at any other time. Oh,\ntempest-tossed believer, it
    is a happy trouble that drives thee to thy Father!\nNow that thou hast only thy
    God to trust to, see that thou puttest thy full\nconfidence in him. Dishonour
    not thy Lord and Master by unworthy doubts and\nfears; but be strong in faith,
    giving glory to God. Show the world that thy God\nis worth ten thousand worlds
    to thee. Show rich men how rich thou art in thy\npoverty when the Lord God is
    thy helper. Show the strong man how strong thou\nart in thy weakness when underneath
    thee are the everlasting arms. Now is the\ntime for feats of faith and valiant
    exploits. Be strong and very courageous,\nand the Lord thy God shall certainly,
    as surely as he built the heavens and the\nearth, glorify himself in thy weakness,
    and magnify his might in the midst of\nthy distress. The grandeur of the arch
    of heaven would be spoiled if the sky\nwere supported by a single visible column,
    and your faith would lose its glory\nif it rested on anything discernible by the
    carnal eye. May the Holy Spirit\ngive you to rest in Jesus this closing day of
    the month.</p>\n<p>Spurgeon, C. H. (1896). Morning and evening: Daily readings.

## Morning, August 31

“On mine arm shall they trust."
—Isaiah 51:5

!!! note "Spurgeon: Morning and Evening"

    In seasons of severe trial, the Christian has nothing on earth that he can
    trust to, and is therefore compelled to cast himself on his God alone. When his
    vessel is on its beam-ends, and no human deliverance can avail, he must simply
    and entirely trust himself to the providence and care of God. Happy storm that
    wrecks a man on such a rock as this! O blessed hurricane that drives the soul
    to God and God alone! There is no getting at our God sometimes because of the
    multitude of our friends; but when a man is so poor, so friendless, so helpless
    that he has nowhere else to turn, he flies into his Father’s arms, and is
    blessedly clasped therein! When he is burdened with troubles so pressing and so
    peculiar, that he cannot tell them to any but his God, he may be thankful for
    them; for he will learn more of his Lord then than at any other time. Oh,
    tempest-tossed believer, it is a happy trouble that drives thee to thy Father!
    Now that thou hast only thy God to trust to, see that thou puttest thy full
    confidence in him. Dishonour not thy Lord and Master by unworthy doubts and
    fears; but be strong in faith, giving glory to God. Show the world that thy God
    is worth ten thousand worlds to thee. Show rich men how rich thou art in thy
    poverty when the Lord God is thy helper. Show the strong man how strong thou
    art in thy weakness when underneath thee are the everlasting arms. Now is the
    time for feats of faith and valiant exploits. Be strong and very courageous,
    and the Lord thy God shall certainly, as surely as he built the heavens and the

    thy distress. The grandeur of the arch of heaven would be spoiled if the sky
    were supported by a single visible column, and your faith would lose its glory
    if it rested on anything discernible by the carnal eye. May the Holy Spirit

## Reflection

By God's grace, I was led this morning through my old Logos dashboard to the evening and morning or the morning and reading daily readings from Charles Spurgeon.
And today, August 31, the morning reading is

!!! note "Isaiah 51:5" 

    "on mine arm, shall they trust.

And it's a short few words, but Spurgeon writes quite a bit about it.
And there's many quotes from this short morning reflection that are very relevant to me in light of my work situation.
One of the things there I've been processing the most is the powerlessness I feel in regards to corporate policy and the control
that my employer wants to exercise over my life.
But the other side of that coin of control is me and me placing my trust in my employer to provide security for me.
And God has been very good to me and still has given me security outside of my primary job.
But I did trust that job.
And it's in the wake of losing it.
I'm not even stretched that thin in losing my job.
But in the stretching that is taking place, Spurgeon says some things about God that I should impress into my heart.

> Oh, blessed hurricane that drives the soul to God and God alone.

Should we not consider trials - Joy?
I'm sure not acting that joyful.
But God has been very sweet to me through these reflections, through drawing my eye and soul to him through the lens of trust.

> There is no getting at our God sometimes because of the multitude of our friends. But when a man is so poor, so friendless, so helpless that he has nowhere else to turn, he flies into his father's arms and is blessedly clasped therein.

Spurgeon clearly isn't saying we can't have friends here.
I think what he is saying is "the multitude of our {idols}", really.
Like Job's friends, maybe, the ones who keep our attention on work and the world and money and my 401k and the future.
Those things are my "__friends__" because those things give me security.
And maybe I have trusted too much, and now God is drawing me closer to him.
And may I say, blessed be the name of the Lord who gives and takes away.
O blessed hurricane that drives the soul to God and God alone.
Amen.
