Here's my thought on <a href="https://linus.dev/posts/setting-up-a-self-hosted-forgejo-actions-runner-with-docker-compose/">ðŸ’­ Setting up a Self-Hosted Forgejo Actions Runner with Docker Co...</a>

As I explore forgjeo this post has a title that sounds very promising! I would like everything to be a docker compose stack for now and I'm struggling a bit with the runner installation - I might be over-complicating it but some parts of the docs aren't as clear as I want them to be - hopefully this post is a good supplement

EDIT:

I've read through this - it's definitely older than forgejo docs on compose, but I like the setup better... It's more of what I would've guessed whereas the official docs have a `dind` image being used it looks like to proxy the tcp traffic from the runner through to a docker engine running in a containerized environment... now that I say it out loud maybe I do like that better... regardless, looking forward to having some self-hosted actions running before EOD
