yesterday: [[2026-02-03-notes]]

- I'm continuing to think about [[nexus]]

  - it's for me, not thinking about other people collaborating on issues
  - it has many purposes now, or could have many depending on how I decide to use it

- With AI continuing to improve, I don't think there's going to be room for Notifiq to really take off as any kind of paid-for service, so as work might slow down from starting my new job I'll probably revisit it some, rip out the SaaSy parts (stripe, etc.) and put it on github... maybe not github... I'm not sure - I think it's cool but I don't necessarily want to feed training data with my ideas for free, ya know?

- added [[ai]] slash page to mention some of my AI usage for the blog
