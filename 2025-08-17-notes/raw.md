## Reflections

- men's group yesterday was a fine conversation about a few things in 1 John 3,
primarily around what it means to "practice" lawlessness
- I have been lacking disicpline or devotion in my theological studies, and
with my time in general, so it's time to start being more faithful to the life
God wants for me

## Runescape

- so fun!
- finally looked up what splashing is for mage training - the staff + full suit of armor make sense finally
