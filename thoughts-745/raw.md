Here's my thought on <a href="https://blog.tjll.net/the-systemd-revolution-has-been-a-success/">ðŸ’­ Tyblog | systemd has been a complete, utter, unmitigated success</a>

I found this post on systemd this morning, and although I've been a Linux user for around 6 years now, there's some levels of it that are pretty foreign to me. One of the things I never got was the drama around systemd - but that's because I wasn't around in the beforefore times, I don't use cron THAT MUCH, and I've only had to setup a few systemd unit files - not enough to generate a real opinion on it.
But lately I'm looking into more automation at home - and some stuff is fun to put into an overkill of a platform for a homelab, like temporal, but some stuff should probably be run in more hardened ways (backups for example) - so getting a little download this morning on systemd from a clearly seasoned Linux user is a nice addition to my hot cup of coffee.
