I've been enjoying my time back in Old School Runescape. Such a classic for me.
The landscape has changed a lot since 2006 though. There's clients and plugins
galore now, no more being limited to a web browser with 1 minute logout timer! 

I started a bit in [[runescape-clients-and-settings]] and in the last several
days I've discovered a few more things that I like.

## Logout

There's not a lot of AFK opportunities in OSRS but there are more than there
used to be. The primary one is splashing to gain magic xp. It's slow but AFK
for as long as you can be. On mobile the logout setting can be changed to 25
minutes so it's easy to leave the game running on my phone for the sake of
leveling up a bit. 

But I prefer to play on desktop because it's so much more beautiful with the HD
117 GPU plugin noted in [[runescape-clients-and-settings#GPU]]. And thankfully
that 25 minute logout timer can be set in this client too!

## Left Click Drop

When power leveling in things like `fishing` or `woodcutting` it's tempting to
pair it with leveling in `cooking` and `firemaking` but the walking time
between fishing, trees, fire etc. does really add up over days and weeks of
playing. There are many tactics, but if money is no object (ie. you're not
trying to bank a ton of gold right now) then you can focus on fishing or
chopping trees and simply dropping inventory as it fills up. This required
right-click, select drop, click for every item in your inventory which is so
tedious.

Luckily there's a plugin for this!

As you can see you just type the name of the items you want the default
left-click to `drop` and I have `willow logs` etc. in here from a few leveling
sessions recently

### Example

By default take this example of `wear Zammorak monk bottom`

![20250831113653_3acbcb94.png](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/pypeaday/images.pype.dev/main/blog-media/20250831113653_3acbcb94.png)

I would never actually want to default drop this item, but let's say I did!

Now the default left-click is `drop` - super easy

## Screenshot

I JUST found this one! There's a screenshot plugin to give you more standardized screenshots of in-game activity...

And then an example of that plugin's screenshot:

## Others

Some noteable others are:

- HD 117 GPU plugin (as noted in [[runescape-clients-and-settings#GPU]])
- `skills progress` shows useful information about the skill you're leveling as an overlay
- `Quest Helper` is huge for me because some of the runescape quests are
legitimately challening, and I'm really here for dad mode... so the quest
helper is a lifesaver
