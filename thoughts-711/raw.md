Here's my thought on <a href="https://n8n.io/workflows/4928-control-your-n8n-instance-remotely-with-telegram-bot-commands/">ðŸ’­ Control Your n8n Instance Remotely with Telegram Bot Commands ...</a>

I'm doing a lot of thinking and brainstorming about how I want to run some pipelines I have in my head, at home... things like image gen for blog posts, posting to various social media, click to generate qr codes and send emails, etc... things that require a lot of integration. 

I tried n8n a while ago with 1 use case, it didn't work but times have changed and whatever was wrong for that use case is now just fixed with a few updates... so I'm strongly considering n8n as a platform I build my workflows on, and using telegram as a simple entry-point into workflow execution is kind of intriguing... imagine sending a message to telegram to generate an image with SD based on a picture you took with our phone, maybe do something else with that image (turn it into a qr code or something), and then email it? all with a text message and pic? that sounds pretty cool... not sure what I"ll have spun up but I am excited to be making some progress on the automation ideas
