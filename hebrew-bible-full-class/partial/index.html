<p>This class is not so much a survey of the HB, it is Tim's attempt to distil the
most helpful things for understanding it in a consumable way for laypeople.</p>
<p>A chunk of this is the other people giving some of their own background. One
lady said something that might be helpful for ministry - &quot;Maybe that thing that
I saw as 'you don't love me' is 'I don't know how to love you'&quot;</p>

<li>Veggie-Tales is uber-guilty of this nonsense</li>

<p class="admonition-title">DL Baker - Two Testaments - One Bible</p>
<p>One of the most fundamental questions which has faced theology and the
Church in every age... is whether or not Christianity also needs an Old
Testament. Is the Old Testament to be thrown away as obsolete, or pre-
served as a relic from days of yore, or treasured as a classic and read by
scholars, or used occasionally as a change from the New Testament, or
kept in a box in case it should be needed some day? Or is the Old Testa-
ment an essential part of the Christian Bible, with continuing validity along-
side the New Testament? —</p>

<p>The Bible most often refers to itself as <em>the Writings</em></p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Road to Emmaus</p>
<p>Jesus confronts a couple guys walking to Emmaus after he is resurrected and
more or less calls them idiots/fools for not understanding that the
Writings point to an annointed king who will suffer death for the sake of
redemption. He's recognized by them once their eyes are opened then he vanishes</p>

<h3>Paul and Timothy</h3>
<p>Paul assumes when writing to Timothy that he, and probably believers in general, are in a community of people who are regularly learning about Yahweh through the Scriptures <em>as a family</em></p>
<div class="admonition scripture">
<p class="admonition-title">2 Timothy 3:15-16</p>
<p>... and that from childhood you ahve known the sacred writings which are
able to give you the wisdom that leas to salvation through faith which is
in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for
teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition success">
<p>For Paul, the <code>Scriptures</code> here are our OT, the Hebrew Bible. For Paul, the HB
is entirely <em>wisdom literature</em> that leads to salvation through Jesus</p>

<p>The question of &quot;What are the Scriptures?&quot; is covered in the next session</p>
<p><strong>To answer the question 'How do we read the HB?' we have to ask the question
'Whose book is the HB?'</strong></p>

<p><code>Old Testament</code> is the Christian term for a set of writings that comprise about
3/4 of the Christian Bible. The authors themselves though refer to those
writings as <code>the Scriptures</code>. One time it is called <code>the Old Covenant</code> by Paul
, but he's talking about Synagogue readings of the Torah portion in synagogues.
THe phrase <code>Hebrew Bible</code> is a modern term that is a bit more neutral.</p>

<p>49 Therefore also the Wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and
apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,’ 50 so that the blood
of all the prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be charged
against this generation, 51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of
Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell
you, it will be required of this generation.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would Jesus pick these two events? Abel is murdered on page 4, Zechariah is
murdered in the last part of Chronicles, which in the TaNaK is significant...
Jesus is saying that <em>all the prophets from the beginning of the Scriptures to
the end</em>... All the prophets from A-Z so to speak</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Scriptures</p>
<p>&quot;Books&quot; as we know it, bound papers with writing on it, called a 'codex'
wasn't a thing until a couple hundred years post-Jesus... so when the
authors say &quot;The Scriptures&quot; we need to keep in mind that Jews had the
scriptures in their minds and hearts, not on paper (save for a couple very
expensive scrolls). So the structure of the scriptures is also apart of the
Jewish being... This interaction with the Scriptures is <em>very very very

<p>Around 100-200 AD there was a split in the Jewish community over things like
how the Temple and sacrifices were to be run, etc. A group got kicked out, so
they grabbed some scrolls and went to start what we'd think of as a Monastic
community. Qumran community is where they went, and the scrolls this group
managed are called the Dead Sea Scrolls.</p>
<p>Out of DSS we have some of the oldest biblical scrolls, they have their own
writings and liturgies since they were all priests basically too.</p>
<p>The scrolls were hidden in caves before the Romans marched on Qumran. They were
found in the 1940s by a bunch of shepherds. A few showed up online for sale and
that's how we found out about their exitence.... These scrolls give us
pre-Christian Jewish Bible nerds...</p>
<p>Qumran community didn't know about Jesus - they thought the Messiah would be a
man called <em>The Teacher of Righteousness</em></p>
<h3>Scroll-making</h3>
<p>The DSS preserved for us, not only ancient biblical texts, but also the method
by which scrolls were created. They were well-preserved papyrus that was
stiched together - literal stitches. We also have obvious additions from Qumran
community as well as notes from priests and corrections from missed
transcribing.</p>
<h3>Our Bible</h3>
<p>The DSS scrolls, being the oldest stitched together set of scrolls, teach us
how scrolls and collections of ancient holy texts were put together. We need to
keep this in mind when we think about where our Christian Bible came from</p>
<p>The beginning and ending of our books might/are filled with hyperlinks that
call a reader's mind back to other stories. It's the way of linking context and
stories to one another before the writings are in a codex</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hyperlinks - language/syntax that remind a reader of antoher scroll - help us
understand the structure of the Hebrew Bible</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">A favorite quote from Tim</p>
<p>So, you can see I'm interested in a historical question of like the
collection [Hebrew Bible] was produced by a group of people. What did they
mean by it? And we can actually know a lot about what they meant and locate
them and read it the way they wanted us to read it, and pick up what
they're saying. And, lo and behold, you know, I hope to convince you
that—and this is all pre-Christian—what's happening here and what this all
points to and means, fits hand in glove with how Jesus and Paul and the
apostles talk about these texts.
So that's different from saying nobody
knew what these texts meant. The events of Jesus happen, and then we go
reread it, and it has a whole new meaning that no one has ever imagined. It
seems to me what actually happened in history was a little more interesting
and complicated than that.  [17:30-18:21]</p>
