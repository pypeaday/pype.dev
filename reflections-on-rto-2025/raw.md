If you're here before [[after-exceeding-expectations-for-4-years]] somehow, go there first

## Giving

I gave Cat a lot over the years... time and energy mostly. It was a good
relationship. In 8 years I had "exceeded expectations" 5 times, "meets
expectations" twice, and one year I got a "superior". This is corpo-jargon
bullshit speak for "I'm a highly valued resource". And throughout that time I
felt appreciated for what I gave. The situations I was put in at Cat forced me
to grow in many uncomfortable ways all at once, but I received dense experience
in a lot of areas of professional life and technology, and that has paid
dividends.

At Cat I felt seen most of the time (save for one of those "meets
expectations" years but that's not the point right now...). I received an award
for some work I began doing in reman that became the rada platform... if you're
reading this than you at least heard about it in the parent post.

So in some significant ways, Cat also gave back to me.

!!! warning "embarrasment"

    But one thing I gave Cat that I'm embarrased by, is trust.

I was told a position would be made remote so I could take it, I moved away, took the
position, and killed it. I believed Caterpillar would fulfil its end of the
bargain - I meet (or exceed) expectations in a remote role, I can live the life
I build in that remote place... but that's apparently not the case, and I'm hurting over
being so cast aside...

Having to sit through meetings where people "bleed cat
yellow", "we're a cat family" etc... the same bullshit you hear anywhere else
though my experience had been somewhat true to that "cat family" vibe... but
it's not a family, it's not even a contract - RTO shows that Cat thinks it's
ownership... there's no business case to bring my role into the office, there's
data to the contrary, but _to quote the head of the Reman Business Unit_

> It's about bringing people into the office

## What I'm Giving Up

"It's about bringing people into the office..."

I was led to believe I could move away and build a life... what about removing
my kids from their school classes, or uprooting my family from our church
community... What possible value could there be in forcing this kind of
disruption on a high-performing individual? It's clearly not about productivity

!!! danger ""

    what an assinine idea... It's purely about control and I think it's disgusting
