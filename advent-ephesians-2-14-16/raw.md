> The reflection in the BP calendar for today was only verses 14-15 but they made no sense to me without some more context

!!! note "Ephesians 2:11-22"

    11 Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh, the
    so-called uncircumcision by the so-called circumcision in the flesh, made by
    hands, 12 that you were at that time apart from Christ, alienated from the
    citizenship of Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, not having
    hope, and without God in the world. 13 But now in Christ Jesus you, the ones
    who once were far away, have become near by the blood of Christ. 14 For he
    himself is our peace, who made both one and broke down the dividing wall of the
    partition, the enmity, in his flesh, 15 invalidating the law of commandments in
    ordinances, in order that he might create the two in himself into one new man,
    thus making peace, 16 and might reconcile both in one body to God through the
    cross, killing the enmity in himself. 17 And coming, he proclaimed the good
    news of peace to you who were far away and peace to the ones who were near,
    18 because through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.
    19 Consequently, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but you
    are fellow citizens of the saints and members of the household of God, 20 built
    on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the
    cornerstone, 21 in whom the whole building, joined together, grows into a holy
    temple in the Lord, 22 in whom you also are built up together into a dwelling
    place of God in the Spirit.

## Summary

It's a dense section, like a lot of Paul's letters, so no surprise. I think the
simplest truth from this passage is that to be a "citizen of heaven" requires
nothing more than to be chosen by Jesus. For much of the Bible, and the history
of Israel, the first requirement was being in the physical nation of Israel -
God's chosen people. Jesus comes to unleash the blessing of adoption and
reconiciliiation onto the whole world, not just one imperfect white-washed
nation.

TLDR: Jesus brings peace through unity of faith in his saving power - there is
nothing that can separate God's own from himself, including who your ancestors
are.

## Peace

"For he himself is our peace"... Amen and amen. My reflections during and prior
to Advent this year have strong running themes of freedom and peace because by
God's grace he's impressing these blessings into my heart. In the stillness of
the morning or the chaos of the afternoon, I can thankfully say that the name
of Jesus never fails to ground my feet in the reality of his kingdom, and at the
very least - draw my eyes above the trial to the horizon - where just like I
can see nothing without the sun's light, the world is clearer and more peaceful
in the light of the Son of God.
