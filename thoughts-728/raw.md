Caught this blog post from Waylon - I added this guy to my RSS feed to star this post. I have tried talos with terraform and struggled myself... I was new to k8s when I first tried but definitely got NOWHERE with it... I don't use k8s at home for anything beyond playing, and I see the power in using it but for now I'm sticking with my pretty vanilla compose setup (plus a few just recipes for yeeting config files to a server)
