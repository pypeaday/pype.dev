<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>What will life be like in God&#39;s fully liberated and healed
world? What will be the best part of that world?
</pre></div>

</pre>

<p>I honestly do not spend a lot of time thinking about the specifics of god's
fully liberated and healed world... I do get emotional pretty much every time
this passage and related ideas come up - freedom from sin and death certainly
has specific consequenes for what daily life will look like. But I don't
actually want to think too much about what that life will be and here's why...</p>
<p>It's like the &quot;don't meet your heros&quot; mentality... It's not that they're
actually a let-down, but we build up heros in our head only to realize that
they're just people too... Seems like this is a pretty common Canon event for a
child in one way or another... Well let's swap out my thoughts about my
childhood hero with my thoughts about Heaven... What do I reasonably <strong>know</strong>
today to look forward to in the life-everlasting?</p>
<ol>
<li>I will no longer be my own master - today in my heart a war rages daily... I
wake up every morning acutely aware of the pieces of me that are hostile to
God - they ache but they're also comfortable... I cannot wait to be fully freed
from this</li>
<li>The whole earth will praise the name of the Lord and to be in community with
people of common mind and faith sounds (again) - freeing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Beyond these 2 high-level truths, which we certainly could unpack a bit more, I
would uncomfortable to make any assertions about what the future kingdom will
look like, but I know I look forward to it</p>
<p>How? How to look forward to something you can't concretely describe in physical
terms? Because my God, the Truth-Teller, is the one who tells us about it... I
don't have to understand everything behing the Word of God - because I trust
the Person of God and therefore his word</p>
