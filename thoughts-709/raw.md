Here's my thought on <a href="https://github.com/pypeaday/whose-turn-is-it">ðŸ’­ pypeaday/whose-turn-is-it: Simple uv webapp to determine order...</a>

We pray together as a family every night, but every single flipping night my daughter's fight about the order we go in... well, NO MORE!

I built a simple uv fastapi app that randomly sorts a list from an environment var `PLAYERS` and presents it in the web page at `/generate`.

Super easy `uv run` at home...

I love that with enough knowledge, or the right kind of knowledge, you can build like anything you want!
