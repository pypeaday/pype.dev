## Reflection

It's time to be more devoted to my work... AI has been a cool technology to
watch and experience but one thing I'm allowing it to do to me is to kill my love for
building... I feel like I'm arriving where I've already seen many talented
developers get to - 

!!! danger "realization"

    AI is not magic, it's a headache. 

Don't get me wrong, targeted and focused use of LLMs, with careful planning and
time-boxing can be great, and has been for me. But I am a creature and prone to
take the path of least resistance, and in many cases I'm just letting the LLM
do the work. This is where the ADHD element from the title comes into play.
Now, I'm not blaming ADHD for me being lazy, because I'm not sure laziness is
the fairest descriptor of where I've been lately. A common issue for those with
ADHD, maybe even the defining characteristic, is the black-hole that's present in the space
where motiviation and reward belong in the brain. I've resonated with this thought for much of my life:

!!! note "Fulfilled or Relieved"

    When I finish tasks, I'm not fulfilled... if anything I'm relieved.

This is a core issue I am seeking to address in my life, and I guess in
real-time reflection I should thank the hellscape of AI and LLMs for surfacing
this pattern in my make-up today instead of when I'm in my 40s or 50s.

So where I've been is that I'll let an LLM write code and then I'll attempt to
be validating the tests or example scripts I prompt it to generate, get
comfortable with it, and ship. 

But then in a few weeks the context of that code is all
lost on me... I didn't craft it with blood and sweat and so when I'm asked a
question about it I realize I'm barely fluent in a thing I built (did I even build it?)! 

This is embarrassing and exhausting... I'm not sure what I'm gonna do about
this, definitely not write about how I'm going to change my life over this
dissastisfaction and from this day forward everything will be different... 

But today does feel like an infelction point in a trajectory I've been on with
AI and my job, so not starting today, but just a decision I am making today, is
to time-box every task with vigorous commitment.
