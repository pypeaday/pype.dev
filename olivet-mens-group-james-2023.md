  by two things:\n\n1. Sermon on the Mount / Matthew 5-7\n2. Proverbs - expecially
  chapters 1-9\n\n### Summary\n\nThese are short challenging wisdom speeches full

  trials produce endurance and can make us _perfect_ and _complete_\n\n_perect_ is
  repeated 7 times in the book - it refers to \"wholeness\" and integrity.\n\nWe are
  all fractrued and inconsistent people\n\n_perfect_: Hebrew: Tamim, Greek: Teleios\n\n5-8:
  God gives wisdom to those who ask in faith\n\n9-11: povety can force us tot rust
  on God alone; wealth will pass away\n\n12-18: God is generous and gives us new birth
  through Jesus\n\n19-27: Don't just listen to God's word but _do_ it. It's the Torah
  of Freedom\n\n- speak with love\n- serve the poor\n- be wholly devoted to God\n\n##
  Jan 21\n\n!!! scripture \"James 1:1\"\n\n    James, a servant of God and of the
  Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes in the Dispersion: Greetings.\n\nDispersion:
  \u03B4\u03B9\u03B1\u03C3\u03C0\u03BF\u03C1\u03AC - same word used by Peter to describe
  Jesus-followers as exiles\n\n!!! scripture \"James 1:2-11\"\n\n    2 Count it all
  joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds,\n    3 for you know that
  the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. 4 And\n    let steadfastness have
  its full effect, that you may be perfect and\n    complete, lacking in nothing.
  \ 5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask\n    God, who gives generously to all
  without reproach, and it will be given\n    him. 6 But let him ask in faith, with
  no doubting, for the one who doubts\n    is like a wave of the sea that is driven
  and tossed by the wind. 7 For that\n    person must not suppose that he will receive
  anything from the Lord; 8 he\n    is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.
  \ 9 Let the lowly brother\n    boast in his exaltation, 10 and the rich in his humiliation,
  because like a\n    flower of the grass he will pass away. 11 For the sun rises
  with its\n    scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty\n
  \   perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.\n\n##

  scripture \"James 3:13-18\"\n\n    13 Who is wise and understanding among you? By
  his good conduct let him\n    show his works in the meekness of wisdom. 14 But if
  you have bitter jealousy\n    and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast
  and be false to the truth.\n    15 This is not the wisdom that comes down from above,
  but is earthly,\n    unspiritual, demonic. 16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition
  exist, there\n    will be disorder and every vile practice. 17 But the wisdom from
  above is first\n    pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy
  and good fruits,\n    impartial and sincere. 18 And a harvest of righteousness is
  sown in peace by\n    those who make peace.\n\n    The Holy Bible: English Standard
  Version (Jas 3:13\u201318). (2016). Crossway\n    Bibles.\n\n## December 16\n\n!!!
  scripture \"James 5:13-20\"\n\n    13 Is anyone among you suffering misfortune?
  He should pray. Is anyone\n    cheerful? He should sing praise. 14 Is anyone among
  you sick? He should\n    summon the elders of the church and they should pray over
  him, anointing\n    him with olive oil in the name of the Lord. 15 And the prayer
  of faith will\n    save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and
  if he has\n    committed sins \u230Ahe will be forgiven\u230B. 16 Therefore confess
  your sins to one\n    another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed.
  The effective\n    prayer of a righteous person accomplishes much. 17 Elijah was
  a human being\n    with the same nature as us, and \u230Ahe prayed fervently\u230B
  for it not to rain,\n    and it did not rain on the land for three years and six
  months. 18 And he\n    prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the earth produced
  its fruit.\n    19 My brothers, if anyone among you should wander away from the
  truth and\n    someone turns him back, 20 he should know that the one who turns
  a sinner\n    back from the error of his way will save that person\u2019s soul from
  death, and\n    will cover over a great number of sins.\n\n### When to pray\n\n1.
  All circumstances of life\n2. Sickness\n3. Confession\n4. Working out the will of
  God\n5. Retrieving wandering souls\n\nJames ends his letter with prayer because
  it's an exhortation of the Disapora\nand a life of faith must revolve around prayer\n\nFor
  myself I think I pray in all circumstances, sickness, confession all ok. I\ndo not
  pray for long periods of time, and don't feel very disiplined, but\nwhenever anything
  happens, by the Lord's grace I am quick to turn my\nattention to Jesus, and hopefully
  turn the attention of my wife/kids to Jesus\nas well. Example: a person collapsed
  at the water park we went to this last\nweekend, Athalia and I were close-ish to
  that happening, so I told her we\nneeded to stop what we were doing and pray that
  Jesus would intervene.\n\nI confess sin to Jesus but I'm not sure what that **should**
  look like. I've\ntaken a Brother Lawrence approach to try and quickly confess and
  move on,\naccepting grace, but I struggle with intentional sinning in this area...
  What\nis prayer if I knew what I was doing was wrong?\n\nI am not more inclined
  to pray for suffering, but I think that's because I've\nvery consciously been trying
  to pray in good circumstances more often because\nwhen we only pray in suffering
  that turns prayer into a Santa's wish list\nsituation I think... yes we need the
  Lord in suffering, but we display our need\nfor him NOT only in suffering, and if
  that is true then it begs the question,\nto me anyways, of whether or not the need
  is truly there\n\n### JC Ryle's quote\n\nI disagree with the dude's quote about
  the requirement of prayer, but only\nbecause the message is given in a direction
  that makes prayer look like\nsomething I have to do to get/keep/maintain my salvation...
  Yahweh changes his\nchildren's hearts and orients them towards him through prayer
  - if someone\ndoesn't then I think that just means Yahweh has not worked or has
  not chosen\nthem, but them calling themselves a Christian is irrelevant, and no
  amount of\nforcing themselves to pray will change Yahweh's will.\n\n!!! scripture
  \"Isaiah 1:6\"\n\n    From the sole of the foot and up to the head\n    there is
  no health in it;\n    bruise and sore and bleeding wound have not been cleansed,\n
  \   and they have not been bound up\n    and not softened with the oil.\n\n!!! scripture
  \"Psalm 23:5\"\n\n    5 You prepare before me a table\n    in the presence of my
  oppressors.\n    You anoint my head with oil;\n    my cup is overflowing.\n\n!!!
  scripture \"1 Kings 17:1-16\"\n\n    17 Elijah the Tishbite from Tishbe of Gilead
  said to Ahab, \u201C\u230AAs Yahweh\n    lives\u230B, the God of Israel before whom
  I stand, there shall surely not be\n    dew nor rain these years \u230Aexcept by
  my command\u230B.\u201D 2 Then the word of Yahweh\n    came to him, saying, 3 \u201CGo
  from this place and turn to the east; you must\n    hide yourself in the Wadi Kerith
  \u230Awhich faces the Jordan\u230B. 4 It shall be\n    that you shall drink from
  the wadi, and I have commanded the crows to\n    sustain you there.\u201D 5 So he
  went and did according to the word of Yahweh.\n    He went and stayed in the Wadi
  Kerith \u230Awhich faces the Jordan\u230B. 6 The crows\n    were bringing bread
  and meat in the morning for him and bread and meat in\n    the evening, and he drank
  from the wadi. 7 It happened \u230Aafter a while\u230B that\n    the wadi dried
  up, because there was no rain in the land.\n\n    8 Then the\n    word of Yahweh
  came to him, saying, 9 \u201CGet up and go to Zarephath which\n    belongs to Sidon
  and stay there. Look, I have commanded a woman there, a\n    widow, to sustain you.\u201D
  10 So he arose and went to Zarephath and came to\n    the gate of the city. There
  was a widow woman gathering wood, so he called\n    to her, and he said, \u201CPlease
  bring a little water for me in a vessel so\n    that I can drink.\u201D 11 She went
  to fetch it, and he called to her and said,\n    \u201CPlease bring me a morsel
  of bread in your hand.\u201D 12 She said, \u201C\u230AAs Yahweh\n    your God lives\u230B,
  surely I do not have a cake, \u230Abut only a handful of flour\u230B\n    in the
  jar and a little olive oil in the jug. Here I am gathering a few\n    pieces of
  wood, and I will go and prepare it for me and my son, that we\n    might eat it
  and die.\u201D 13 Elijah said to her, \u201CDon\u2019t be afraid. Go and do\n    according
  to your word; only make for me a small bread cake from it first,\n    and bring
  it out to me. Make it for yourself and for your son afterward.\n    14 For thus
  says Yahweh, the God of Israel: \u2018The jar of flour will not be\n    emptied
  and the jug of olive oil will not run out until the day Yahweh\n    gives rain on
  the surface of the earth.\u2019 \u201D 15 So she went and did according\n    to
  the word of Elijah; then both she and he ate with her household for many\n    days.
  16 The jar of flour was not emptied and the jug of olive oil did not\n    run out,
  according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of\n    Elijah."

    when you meet trials of various kinds,\n3 for you know that the testing of your
    faith produces steadfastness. 4 And\nlet steadfastness have its full effect, that
    you may be perfect and\ncomplete, lacking in nothing.  5 If any of you lacks wisdom,
    let him ask\nGod, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be
    given\nhim. 6 But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts\nis
    like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. 7 For that\nperson
    must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; 8 he\nis a double-minded
    man, unstable in all his ways.  9 Let the lowly brother\nboast in his exaltation,
    10 and the rich in his humiliation, because like a\nflower of the grass he will
    pass away. 11 For the sun rises with its\nscorching heat and withers the grass;
    its flower falls, and its beauty\nperishes. So also will the rich man fade away
    in the midst of his pursuits.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"july-15\">July 15 <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him\nshow his
    works in the meekness of wisdom. 14 But if you have bitter jealousy\nand selfish
    ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.\n15 This is not
    the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly,\nunspiritual, demonic.
    16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there\nwill be disorder and
    every vile practice. 17 But the wisdom from above is first\npure, then peaceable,
    gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits,\nimpartial and sincere.
    18 And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by\nthose who make peace.</p>\n<p>The

    scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">James 5:13-20</p>\n<p>13 Is anyone
    among you suffering misfortune? He should pray. Is anyone\ncheerful? He should
    sing praise. 14 Is anyone among you sick? He should\nsummon the elders of the
    church and they should pray over him, anointing\nhim with olive oil in the name
    of the Lord. 15 And the prayer of faith will\nsave the one who is sick, and the
    Lord will raise him up, and if he has\ncommitted sins \u230Ahe will be forgiven\u230B.
    16 Therefore confess your sins to one\nanother, and pray for one another, so that
    you may be healed. The effective\nprayer of a righteous person accomplishes much.
    17 Elijah was a human being\nwith the same nature as us, and \u230Ahe prayed fervently\u230B
    for it not to rain,\nand it did not rain on the land for three years and six months.
    18 And he\nprayed again, and the sky gave rain and the earth produced its fruit.\n19
    My brothers, if anyone among you should wander away from the truth and\nsomeone
    turns him back, 20 he should know that the one who turns a sinner\nback from the
    error of his way will save that person\u2019s soul from death, and\nwill cover
    over a great number of sins.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>When to pray</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>All
    circumstances of life</li>\n<li>Sickness</li>\n<li>Confession</li>\n<li>Working
    out the will of God</li>\n<li>Retrieving wandering souls</li>\n</ol>\n<p>James
    ends his letter with prayer because it's an exhortation of the Disapora\nand a
    life of faith must revolve around prayer</p>\n<p>For myself I think I pray in
    all circumstances, sickness, confession all ok. I\ndo not pray for long periods
    of time, and don't feel very disiplined, but\nwhenever anything happens, by the
    Lord's grace I am quick to turn my\nattention to Jesus, and hopefully turn the
    attention of my wife/kids to Jesus\nas well. Example: a person collapsed at the
    water park we went to this last\nweekend, Athalia and I were close-ish to that
    happening, so I told her we\nneeded to stop what we were doing and pray that Jesus
    would intervene.</p>\n<p>I confess sin to Jesus but I'm not sure what that <strong>should</strong>
    look like. I've\ntaken a Brother Lawrence approach to try and quickly confess
    and move on,\naccepting grace, but I struggle with intentional sinning in this
    area... What\nis prayer if I knew what I was doing was wrong?</p>\n<p>I am not
    more inclined to pray for suffering, but I think that's because I've\nvery consciously
    been trying to pray in good circumstances more often because\nwhen we only pray
    in suffering that turns prayer into a Santa's wish list\nsituation I think...
    yes we need the Lord in suffering, but we display our need\nfor him NOT only in
    suffering, and if that is true then it begs the question,\nto me anyways, of whether
    or not the need is truly there</p>\n<h3>JC Ryle's quote</h3>\n<p>I disagree with
    the dude's quote about the requirement of prayer, but only\nbecause the message
    is given in a direction that makes prayer look like\nsomething I have to do to
    get/keep/maintain my salvation... Yahweh changes his\nchildren's hearts and orients
    them towards him through prayer - if someone\ndoesn't then I think that just means
    Yahweh has not worked or has not chosen\nthem, but them calling themselves a Christian
    is irrelevant, and no amount of\nforcing themselves to pray will change Yahweh's
    will.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Isaiah

    Kings 17:1-16</p>\n<p>17 Elijah the Tishbite from Tishbe of Gilead said to Ahab,
    \u201C\u230AAs Yahweh\nlives\u230B, the God of Israel before whom I stand, there
    shall surely not be\ndew nor rain these years \u230Aexcept by my command\u230B.\u201D
    2 Then the word of Yahweh\ncame to him, saying, 3 \u201CGo from this place and
    turn to the east; you must\nhide yourself in the Wadi Kerith \u230Awhich faces
    the Jordan\u230B. 4 It shall be\nthat you shall drink from the wadi, and I have
    commanded the crows to\nsustain you there.\u201D 5 So he went and did according
    to the word of Yahweh.\nHe went and stayed in the Wadi Kerith \u230Awhich faces
    the Jordan\u230B. 6 The crows\nwere bringing bread and meat in the morning for
    him and bread and meat in\nthe evening, and he drank from the wadi. 7 It happened
    \u230Aafter a while\u230B that\nthe wadi dried up, because there was no rain in
    the land.</p>\n<p>8 Then the\nword of Yahweh came to him, saying, 9 \u201CGet
    up and go to Zarephath which\nbelongs to Sidon and stay there. Look, I have commanded
    a woman there, a\nwidow, to sustain you.\u201D 10 So he arose and went to Zarephath
    and came to\nthe gate of the city. There was a widow woman gathering wood, so
    he called\nto her, and he said, \u201CPlease bring a little water for me in a
    vessel so\nthat I can drink.\u201D 11 She went to fetch it, and he called to her
    and said,\n\u201CPlease bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.\u201D 12 She
    said, \u201C\u230AAs Yahweh\nyour God lives\u230B, surely I do not have a cake,
    \u230Abut only a handful of flour\u230B\nin the jar and a little olive oil in
    the jug. Here I am gathering a few\npieces of wood, and I will go and prepare
    it for me and my son, that we\nmight eat it and die.\u201D 13 Elijah said to her,
    \u201CDon\u2019t be afraid. Go and do\naccording to your word; only make for me
    a small bread cake from it first,\nand bring it out to me. Make it for yourself
    and for your son afterward.\n14 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: \u2018The
    jar of flour will not be\nemptied and the jug of olive oil will not run out until
    the day Yahweh\ngives rain on the surface of the earth.\u2019 \u201D 15 So she
    went and did according\nto the word of Elijah; then both she and he ate with her
    household for many\ndays. 16 The jar of flour was not emptied and the jug of olive
    oil did not\nrun out, according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand
    of\nElijah.</p>\n</div>\n\n        </section>\n    </article>\n</section>        </div>\n

    ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.\n15 This is not

    among you suffering misfortune? He should pray. Is anyone\ncheerful? He should
    sing praise. 14 Is anyone among you sick? He should\nsummon the elders of the
    church and they should pray over him, anointing\nhim with olive oil in the name
    of the Lord. 15 And the prayer of faith will\nsave the one who is sick, and the
    Lord will raise him up, and if he has\ncommitted sins \u230Ahe will be forgiven\u230B.
    16 Therefore confess your sins to one\nanother, and pray for one another, so that
    you may be healed. The effective\nprayer of a righteous person accomplishes much.
    17 Elijah was a human being\nwith the same nature as us, and \u230Ahe prayed fervently\u230B
    for it not to rain,\nand it did not rain on the land for three years and six months.
    18 And he\nprayed again, and the sky gave rain and the earth produced its fruit.\n19
    My brothers, if anyone among you should wander away from the truth and\nsomeone
    turns him back, 20 he should know that the one who turns a sinner\nback from the
    error of his way will save that person\u2019s soul from death, and\nwill cover
    over a great number of sins.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>When to pray</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>All

    out the will of God</li>\n<li>Retrieving wandering souls</li>\n</ol>\n<p>James
    ends his letter with prayer because it's an exhortation of the Disapora\nand a
    life of faith must revolve around prayer</p>\n<p>For myself I think I pray in
    all circumstances, sickness, confession all ok. I\ndo not pray for long periods
    of time, and don't feel very disiplined, but\nwhenever anything happens, by the
    Lord's grace I am quick to turn my\nattention to Jesus, and hopefully turn the
    attention of my wife/kids to Jesus\nas well. Example: a person collapsed at the
    water park we went to this last\nweekend, Athalia and I were close-ish to that
    happening, so I told her we\nneeded to stop what we were doing and pray that Jesus
    would intervene.</p>\n<p>I confess sin to Jesus but I'm not sure what that <strong>should</strong>
    look like. I've\ntaken a Brother Lawrence approach to try and quickly confess
    and move on,\naccepting grace, but I struggle with intentional sinning in this
    area... What\nis prayer if I knew what I was doing was wrong?</p>\n<p>I am not
    more inclined to pray for suffering, but I think that's because I've\nvery consciously
    been trying to pray in good circumstances more often because\nwhen we only pray
    in suffering that turns prayer into a Santa's wish list\nsituation I think...
    yes we need the Lord in suffering, but we display our need\nfor him NOT only in
    suffering, and if that is true then it begs the question,\nto me anyways, of whether
    or not the need is truly there</p>\n<h3>JC Ryle's quote</h3>\n<p>I disagree with
    the dude's quote about the requirement of prayer, but only\nbecause the message
    is given in a direction that makes prayer look like\nsomething I have to do to
    get/keep/maintain my salvation... Yahweh changes his\nchildren's hearts and orients
    them towards him through prayer - if someone\ndoesn't then I think that just means
    Yahweh has not worked or has not chosen\nthem, but them calling themselves a Christian
    is irrelevant, and no amount of\nforcing themselves to pray will change Yahweh's
    will.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition scripture\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Isaiah

    shall surely not be\ndew nor rain these years \u230Aexcept by my command\u230B.\u201D
    2 Then the word of Yahweh\ncame to him, saying, 3 \u201CGo from this place and
    turn to the east; you must\nhide yourself in the Wadi Kerith \u230Awhich faces
    the Jordan\u230B. 4 It shall be\nthat you shall drink from the wadi, and I have
    commanded the crows to\nsustain you there.\u201D 5 So he went and did according
    to the word of Yahweh.\nHe went and stayed in the Wadi Kerith \u230Awhich faces
    the Jordan\u230B. 6 The crows\nwere bringing bread and meat in the morning for
    him and bread and meat in\nthe evening, and he drank from the wadi. 7 It happened
    \u230Aafter a while\u230B that\nthe wadi dried up, because there was no rain in
    the land.</p>\n<p>8 Then the\nword of Yahweh came to him, saying, 9 \u201CGet
    up and go to Zarephath which\nbelongs to Sidon and stay there. Look, I have commanded
    a woman there, a\nwidow, to sustain you.\u201D 10 So he arose and went to Zarephath
    and came to\nthe gate of the city. There was a widow woman gathering wood, so
    he called\nto her, and he said, \u201CPlease bring a little water for me in a
    vessel so\nthat I can drink.\u201D 11 She went to fetch it, and he called to her
    and said,\n\u201CPlease bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.\u201D 12 She
    said, \u201C\u230AAs Yahweh\nyour God lives\u230B, surely I do not have a cake,
    \u230Abut only a handful of flour\u230B\nin the jar and a little olive oil in
    the jug. Here I am gathering a few\npieces of wood, and I will go and prepare
    it for me and my son, that we\nmight eat it and die.\u201D 13 Elijah said to her,
    \u201CDon\u2019t be afraid. Go and do\naccording to your word; only make for me
    a small bread cake from it first,\nand bring it out to me. Make it for yourself
    and for your son afterward.\n14 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: \u2018The

    when you meet trials of various kinds,\n3 for you know that the testing of your
    faith produces steadfastness. 4 And\nlet steadfastness have its full effect, that
    you may be perfect and\ncomplete, lacking in nothing.  5 If any of you lacks wisdom,
    let him ask\nGod, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be
    given\nhim. 6 But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts\nis
    like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. 7 For that\nperson
    must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; 8 he\nis a double-minded
    man, unstable in all his ways.  9 Let the lowly brother\nboast in his exaltation,
    10 and the rich in his humiliation, because like a\nflower of the grass he will
    pass away. 11 For the sun rises with its\nscorching heat and withers the grass;
    its flower falls, and its beauty\nperishes. So also will the rich man fade away
    in the midst of his pursuits.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"july-15\">July 15 <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him\nshow his
    works in the meekness of wisdom. 14 But if you have bitter jealousy\nand selfish
    ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.\n15 This is not

# James

2023 study of the book of James

## BP

### The Guy

Greek: Iakobos (Jacob in English)

Jacob is one of Jesus' half-brothers who became a leader of the Jerusalem church post-resurrection

The book of James is the legacy of this Jacob's wisdom which was heavily influenced by two things:

1. Sermon on the Mount / Matthew 5-7
2. Proverbs - expecially chapters 1-9

### Summary

These are short challenging wisdom speeches full of metaphors and one-liners... Live in a wise way, submitting to Jesus

Chapters 2-5 teach about wholehearted devotion to Jesus - there are 12 teachings total

Chapter 1 the introduction

2-4: life's trials produce endurance and can make us _perfect_ and _complete_

_perect_ is repeated 7 times in the book - it refers to "wholeness" and integrity.

We are all fractrued and inconsistent people

_perfect_: Hebrew: Tamim, Greek: Teleios

5-8: God gives wisdom to those who ask in faith

9-11: povety can force us tot rust on God alone; wealth will pass away

12-18: God is generous and gives us new birth through Jesus

19-27: Don't just listen to God's word but _do_ it. It's the Torah of Freedom

- speak with love
- serve the poor
- be wholly devoted to God

## Jan 21

!!! scripture "James 1:1"

    James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes in the Dispersion: Greetings.

Dispersion: διασπορά - same word used by Peter to describe Jesus-followers as exiles

!!! scripture "James 1:2-11"

    2 Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds,
    3 for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. 4 And
    let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and
    complete, lacking in nothing.  5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask
    God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given
    him. 6 But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts
    is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. 7 For that
    person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; 8 he
    is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.  9 Let the lowly brother
    boast in his exaltation, 10 and the rich in his humiliation, because like a
    flower of the grass he will pass away. 11 For the sun rises with its
    scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty
    perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.

> Missed several meetings due to unfortunate travel circumstances

!!! scripture "James 3:13-18"

    13 Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him
    show his works in the meekness of wisdom. 14 But if you have bitter jealousy
    and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.
    15 This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly,
    unspiritual, demonic. 16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there
    will be disorder and every vile practice. 17 But the wisdom from above is first
    pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits,
    impartial and sincere. 18 And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by
    those who make peace.

## December 16

!!! scripture "James 5:13-20"

    13 Is anyone among you suffering misfortune? He should pray. Is anyone
    cheerful? He should sing praise. 14 Is anyone among you sick? He should
    summon the elders of the church and they should pray over him, anointing
    him with olive oil in the name of the Lord. 15 And the prayer of faith will
    save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has
    committed sins ⌊he will be forgiven⌋. 16 Therefore confess your sins to one
    another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The effective
    prayer of a righteous person accomplishes much. 17 Elijah was a human being
    with the same nature as us, and ⌊he prayed fervently⌋ for it not to rain,
    and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. 18 And he
    prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the earth produced its fruit.
    19 My brothers, if anyone among you should wander away from the truth and
    someone turns him back, 20 he should know that the one who turns a sinner
    back from the error of his way will save that person’s soul from death, and
    will cover over a great number of sins.

### When to pray

1. All circumstances of life
2. Sickness
3. Confession
4. Working out the will of God
5. Retrieving wandering souls

James ends his letter with prayer because it's an exhortation of the Disapora
and a life of faith must revolve around prayer

For myself I think I pray in all circumstances, sickness, confession all ok. I
do not pray for long periods of time, and don't feel very disiplined, but
whenever anything happens, by the Lord's grace I am quick to turn my
attention to Jesus, and hopefully turn the attention of my wife/kids to Jesus
as well. Example: a person collapsed at the water park we went to this last
weekend, Athalia and I were close-ish to that happening, so I told her we
needed to stop what we were doing and pray that Jesus would intervene.

I confess sin to Jesus but I'm not sure what that **should** look like. I've
taken a Brother Lawrence approach to try and quickly confess and move on,
accepting grace, but I struggle with intentional sinning in this area... What
is prayer if I knew what I was doing was wrong?

I am not more inclined to pray for suffering, but I think that's because I've
very consciously been trying to pray in good circumstances more often because
when we only pray in suffering that turns prayer into a Santa's wish list
situation I think... yes we need the Lord in suffering, but we display our need
for him NOT only in suffering, and if that is true then it begs the question,
to me anyways, of whether or not the need is truly there

### JC Ryle's quote

I disagree with the dude's quote about the requirement of prayer, but only
because the message is given in a direction that makes prayer look like
something I have to do to get/keep/maintain my salvation... Yahweh changes his
children's hearts and orients them towards him through prayer - if someone
doesn't then I think that just means Yahweh has not worked or has not chosen
them, but them calling themselves a Christian is irrelevant, and no amount of
forcing themselves to pray will change Yahweh's will.

!!! scripture "Isaiah 1:6"

    From the sole of the foot and up to the head
    there is no health in it;
    bruise and sore and bleeding wound have not been cleansed,
    and they have not been bound up
    and not softened with the oil.

!!! scripture "Psalm 23:5"

    5 You prepare before me a table
    in the presence of my oppressors.
    You anoint my head with oil;
    my cup is overflowing.

!!! scripture "1 Kings 17:1-16"

    17 Elijah the Tishbite from Tishbe of Gilead said to Ahab, “⌊As Yahweh
    lives⌋, the God of Israel before whom I stand, there shall surely not be
    dew nor rain these years ⌊except by my command⌋.” 2 Then the word of Yahweh
    came to him, saying, 3 “Go from this place and turn to the east; you must
    hide yourself in the Wadi Kerith ⌊which faces the Jordan⌋. 4 It shall be
    that you shall drink from the wadi, and I have commanded the crows to
    sustain you there.” 5 So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh.
    He went and stayed in the Wadi Kerith ⌊which faces the Jordan⌋. 6 The crows
    were bringing bread and meat in the morning for him and bread and meat in
    the evening, and he drank from the wadi. 7 It happened ⌊after a while⌋ that
    the wadi dried up, because there was no rain in the land.

    8 Then the
    word of Yahweh came to him, saying, 9 “Get up and go to Zarephath which
    belongs to Sidon and stay there. Look, I have commanded a woman there, a
    widow, to sustain you.” 10 So he arose and went to Zarephath and came to
    the gate of the city. There was a widow woman gathering wood, so he called
    to her, and he said, “Please bring a little water for me in a vessel so
    that I can drink.” 11 She went to fetch it, and he called to her and said,
    “Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.” 12 She said, “⌊As Yahweh
    your God lives⌋, surely I do not have a cake, ⌊but only a handful of flour⌋
    in the jar and a little olive oil in the jug. Here I am gathering a few
    pieces of wood, and I will go and prepare it for me and my son, that we
    might eat it and die.” 13 Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go and do
    according to your word; only make for me a small bread cake from it first,
    and bring it out to me. Make it for yourself and for your son afterward.
    14 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘The jar of flour will not be
    emptied and the jug of olive oil will not run out until the day Yahweh
    gives rain on the surface of the earth.’ ” 15 So she went and did according
    to the word of Elijah; then both she and he ate with her household for many
    days. 16 The jar of flour was not emptied and the jug of olive oil did not
    run out, according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of
    Elijah.
