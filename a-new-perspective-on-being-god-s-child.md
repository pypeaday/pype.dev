  came up almost inevitably\nis a debate between God's sovereignty and predestination,
  and then an idea of free will.\nI have been a part of these conversations for years
  - I've been in hundreds of them certainly,\nand they all go in a very similar direction.
  Almost irrespective of the theological prowess\nor training of the group of people
  I'm in the unspoken goal always is the same... \n**to find a hard and fast line
  between the 2 things or to find some comfortable verbiage for the tension**\n\n##
  My Anecdotal Experience With Other Believers\n\nPeople with no real theological
  background have very simple ideas and\nunderstandings of free will and God's sovereignty.\nThey
  typically equate God's sovereignty with \"He willed everything to be, and so you
  don't\nactually have any real choices.\"\nThen they think that because God has ultimate
  sovereignty, but they have free will, they\ncan somehow contradict God's will, but
  then they don't understand that that is a violation\nof the doctrine of God's sovereignty.\nSo
  those conversations are typically hard to sit through, and my historical thought\non
  that, ever since I believe I've come to a pretty mature position on the matter,\nhas
  been that in the Hebrew mind, these things aren't at odds, and we create the division
  with our\nWestern ideals on what it means to make choices, and what it means to
  be free.\n\n### Freedom\n\nAs a quick parenthetical remark on that - freedom is
  not doing whatever you want.\nTrue freedom is living in accordance with your creation,
  bound by the things that create\norder, because it is within those boundaries that
  you were designed to live -\nand thus the life you live within the boundaries is
  the best the life could\nbe... Freedom isn't the ultimate goal, it's a byproduct
  of living in accordance\nwith our design.\nWhen you break those boundaries though
  - then life is scary, and you are not\nfree but rather a slave to the environment
  you made for yourself - an\nenvironment not designed for you because you designed
  it for yourself, it isn't\nwhat the Maker made for you\n\n### Freedom - Child's
  Play\n\nAn easy example is kids on a playground.\nIf you give a bunch of little
  kids a playground with nice high fences, and you tell them to\ndo whatever they
  want in the playground, they'll have a great time.\nBut if you take all the fences
  away from that playground, maybe even move it\nout further away from the school,
  kids tend to feel a lot less safe.\nBecause now, not only can they just wander as
  far away from it as they please, perhaps\nby accident, but dangers can now enter
  their playground... The fences gave them\nthe freedom to enjoy the life appropriate
  for them.\n\n## Back To the Debate\n\nReturning to the sovereignty and free will
  discussion... \nWith no academic, theological, or honestly even critical thinking\napplied,
  we have this very silly juxtaposition of sovereignty - as if it means\nyou can't
  make choices - and free will as if God's sovereignty could be usurped\nby us.\nHowever,
  in groups where we have more theological training present, we really just have the\nsame
  (directionally speaking - the same) conversation, with a larger vocabulary.\nNow
  we have words like \"agency\", and \"scope of choice\", things that kind of seek
  to explain\naway the tension by introducing new dimension or element of abstraction
  to the argument.\n\nAt the end of the day, we're now just cutting the cake into
  smaller pieces.\nWe're just filling in some of the gaps that we can see.\nThere's
  still nuance.\nThere's still the Western influence of needing to label everything.\nThere's
  still, in my opinion, the ancient truth that in the Hebrew mind, Yahweh's sovereignty\nand
  the human's choice to live their life are not at odds with each other.\n\n## A New
  Perspective\n\nBut here's a thought I started to formulate just recently...\n\n!!!
  note a recent thought\n    Even for a PhD in theological studies or in theology
  or an expert in church history or\n    church fathers or whatever - for somebody
  _today_ to think that we can define these terms \n    in a totally correct and understandable
  way is another manifestation of the\n    __PEAK ARROGANCE__ of the West  (Blog on
  Western v Eastern medicine in the works)\n\nI don't mean to claim here that I have
  the _right_ understanding of sovereignty and free will.\nBut Paul has some choice
  words for believers who love quarreling and debates, and he calls\nthem spiritual
  children who aren't ready for real food.\n\n!!! source 2 Timothy 2:23-24\n\n    23
  But reject foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they breed quarrels.\n    24
  The Lord's slave must not quarrel, but must be gentle to everyone, able to teach,
  and patient,\n\n!!! source 1 Corinthians 3\n    1For my part, brothers and sisters,
  I was not able to speak to you as spiritual\n    people but as people of the flesh,
  as babies in Christ.a 2I gave you milk to\n    drink, not solid food, since you
  were not yet ready for it. In fact, you are\n    still not ready, 3because you are
  still worldly. For since there is envya and\n    strifea b among you, are you not
  worldly and behaving like mere humans? 4For\n    whenever someone says, \u201CI
  belong to Paul,\u201D and another, \u201CI belong to Apollos,\u201Da\n\n!!! warning
  It's you\n    I've often heard the Corinthian church used as an example of a bad
  place to\n    be - and no doubt it was. But modern American Christianity may be
  much closer\n    to Corinth than Thessolinca as far as maturity and Christ-like
  living goes.\n\nHe says things like \"I gave you milk to drink, not solid food,
  since you were\nnot yet ready for it\"\nI used to think that the \"real food\" was
  these theological debates, that you learn\nmore about the Bible, you learn more
  about humanity, and then you can have these more\nin-depth conversations.\nBut I
  think the real wisdom is easly seen with a metaphor\n\n### Who's the child here?\n\nI
  have two daughters in different developmental stages, and so we have 3 characters...\nThere's
  my young daughter, my older daughter, and me.\nRight away, I think we often talk
  about knowing God in this kind of a term where,\nyou know, I'm his child and I have
  children.\nSo there's a parent-child relationship.\nAnd then in the God-human relationship,
  I understand my position better now as a parent\nof real children, of humans, which
  helps me understand my position as a child of God.\n\n!!! failure \"\"\n    I don't
  think we take that very seriously.\n\n!!! success \"\"\n    I think use this more
  as comforting language rather than a humbling truth - __I'm a child of God__\n    But
  really, I think the TLDR is that even the most highly trained theological individual
  - that person is not a grown-up in the eyes of God.\n    He or she is still a child,
  and our understanding is still limited to what a child can understand.\n\nLet's
  continue with the metaphor...\n\nYou could ask either one of my daughters if they
  know me, and of course they would both\nsay yes, and they know me to different degrees.\nPerhaps
  because the older one knows more about me - does that mean that she knows me better
  than the younger?\nI think it would be silly to say yes.\nBoth of my kids know me
  to the fullest capacity that they can know me.\nSo what about love?\nDo they both
  love me?\nAnd do I love them?\nOf course.\nAnd do I show my love to both of them
  in the same ways?\nOf course not.\nNot only are they unique, but they're at different
  stages in life... \n\nFor example - I don't exercise the same amount of discipline
  towards my\nyoungest because she's not ready for it - it's not reasonable to expect
  the\nsame things of her as our older daughter.\nSpeaking of her - she absolutely
  is ready for some more discipline and for some\nhigher expectations, and so I will
  train her up in the ways that she is mature\nenough to understand.\nNow, does that
  mean I love my younger daughter less, or does it mean I love my older daughter\nmore?\nNo.\nIt
  means I'm loving them in a way that is appropriate for where they are at\ndevelopmentally,
  for their better good.\nSo that they grow up to be ordered, to be competent, to
  be self-controlled, and\nto not grow up to be wild adults with no regard for boundaries
  and rules.\n\nSo to be specific about the metaphor and the example I just laid out:
  I don't want my children\nto ever hurt or suffer, but I also know that suffering
  is required for learning and for them to grow to be mature individuals.\nI know
  how to control some of the inevitable suffering a child must endure, especially
  if it's in the form of discipline, for my children so they are safe, protected,
  loved, but also corrected and molded into competent human beings.\n\n### The Kicker\n\nNow
  would it be appropriate for my older daughter (who understands that suffering is
  required\nfor learning) would it be appropriate for her to look at my younger daughter
  and tell\nher, \"dad wants you to suffer\"?\nThat's tough, isn't it...\nBecause
  she's not really lying, but more importantly she's also not telling anything close
  to the whole\ntruth and she is also not talking to somebody who is capable of understanding
  the nuances\nof that truth.\n\nIn the eyes of God, I'm still a five-year-old.\n\nAnd
  for me as a five-year-old boy in the eyes of the Lord, to try and explain things
  that\nI think I understand or that I understand to the best capability that a five-year-old
  can -\nIf I go try to teach a three-year-old things about God in ways that they
  can't understand,\nI am not loving that other person and I'm not even loving God
  very well.\nI'm just stuck in my own arrogance of understanding, thinking that I
  now get it because I've come\nto my own realization.\n\n> I recognize there's a
  little irony now in writing this post because I'm\n> saying I think I kind of understand
  that I don't/can't understand the sovereignty\n> and free will relationship. I wouldn't
  say I can explain that away, but I\n> think I understand who I am better in the
  eyes of the Lord and what I could\n> reasonably expect to understand from an academic
  standpoint.\n\n## So What?\n\nThe lesson for me, and for my community of faith -
  is to calm down about the\ndebates.... They're fun over a drink and cigars, but
  when boots are on the\nground we need to remember that the Bible has information
  that we need to know,\nit doesn't have all the information that we want to know
  - and the American\nChurch must drop its arrogant need to explain away every mystery
  and instead\nhold fast to the God of those mysteries."

    theological background have very simple ideas and\nunderstandings of free will
    and God's sovereignty.\nThey typically equate God's sovereignty with &quot;He
    willed everything to be, and so you don't\nactually have any real choices.&quot;\nThen
    they think that because God has ultimate sovereignty, but they have free will,
    they\ncan somehow contradict God's will, but then they don't understand that that
    is a violation\nof the doctrine of God's sovereignty.\nSo those conversations
    are typically hard to sit through, and my historical thought\non that, ever since
    I believe I've come to a pretty mature position on the matter,\nhas been that
    in the Hebrew mind, these things aren't at odds, and we create the division with
    our\nWestern ideals on what it means to make choices, and what it means to be
    free.</p>\n<h3>Freedom</h3>\n<p>As a quick parenthetical remark on that - freedom
    is not doing whatever you want.\nTrue freedom is living in accordance with your
    creation, bound by the things that create\norder, because it is within those boundaries
    that you were designed to live -\nand thus the life you live within the boundaries
    is the best the life could\nbe... Freedom isn't the ultimate goal, it's a byproduct
    of living in accordance\nwith our design.\nWhen you break those boundaries though
    - then life is scary, and you are not\nfree but rather a slave to the environment
    you made for yourself - an\nenvironment not designed for you because you designed
    it for yourself, it isn't\nwhat the Maker made for you</p>\n<h3>Freedom - Child's
    Play</h3>\n<p>An easy example is kids on a playground.\nIf you give a bunch of
    little kids a playground with nice high fences, and you tell them to\ndo whatever
    they want in the playground, they'll have a great time.\nBut if you take all the
    fences away from that playground, maybe even move it\nout further away from the
    school, kids tend to feel a lot less safe.\nBecause now, not only can they just
    wander as far away from it as they please, perhaps\nby accident, but dangers can
    now enter their playground... The fences gave them\nthe freedom to enjoy the life
    appropriate for them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"back-to-the-debate\">Back To the Debate <a

    and free will discussion...\nWith no academic, theological, or honestly even critical
    thinking\napplied, we have this very silly juxtaposition of sovereignty - as if
    it means\nyou can't make choices - and free will as if God's sovereignty could
    be usurped\nby us.\nHowever, in groups where we have more theological training
    present, we really just have the\nsame (directionally speaking - the same) conversation,
    with a larger vocabulary.\nNow we have words like &quot;agency&quot;, and &quot;scope
    of choice&quot;, things that kind of seek to explain\naway the tension by introducing
    new dimension or element of abstraction to the argument.</p>\n<p>At the end of
    the day, we're now just cutting the cake into smaller pieces.\nWe're just filling
    in some of the gaps that we can see.\nThere's still nuance.\nThere's still the
    Western influence of needing to label everything.\nThere's still, in my opinion,
    the ancient truth that in the Hebrew mind, Yahweh's sovereignty\nand the human's
    choice to live their life are not at odds with each other.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-new-perspective\">A

    have these more\nin-depth conversations.\nBut I think the real wisdom is easly
    seen with a metaphor</p>\n<h3>Who's the child here?</h3>\n<p>I have two daughters
    in different developmental stages, and so we have 3 characters...\nThere's my
    young daughter, my older daughter, and me.\nRight away, I think we often talk
    about knowing God in this kind of a term where,\nyou know, I'm his child and I
    have children.\nSo there's a parent-child relationship.\nAnd then in the God-human
    relationship, I understand my position better now as a parent\nof real children,
    of humans, which helps me understand my position as a child of God.</p>\n<div
    class=\"admonition failure\">\n<p>I don't think we take that very seriously.</p>\n</div>\n<div
    class=\"admonition success\">\n<p>I think use this more as comforting language
    rather than a humbling truth - <strong>I'm a child of God</strong>\nBut really,
    I think the TLDR is that even the most highly trained theological individual -
    that person is not a grown-up in the eyes of God.\nHe or she is still a child,
    and our understanding is still limited to what a child can understand.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Let's
    continue with the metaphor...</p>\n<p>You could ask either one of my daughters
    if they know me, and of course they would both\nsay yes, and they know me to different
    degrees.\nPerhaps because the older one knows more about me - does that mean that
    she knows me better than the younger?\nI think it would be silly to say yes.\nBoth
    of my kids know me to the fullest capacity that they can know me.\nSo what about
    love?\nDo they both love me?\nAnd do I love them?\nOf course.\nAnd do I show my
    love to both of them in the same ways?\nOf course not.\nNot only are they unique,
    but they're at different stages in life...</p>\n<p>For example - I don't exercise
    the same amount of discipline towards my\nyoungest because she's not ready for
    it - it's not reasonable to expect the\nsame things of her as our older daughter.\nSpeaking
    of her - she absolutely is ready for some more discipline and for some\nhigher
    expectations, and so I will train her up in the ways that she is mature\nenough
    to understand.\nNow, does that mean I love my younger daughter less, or does it
    mean I love my older daughter\nmore?\nNo.\nIt means I'm loving them in a way that
    is appropriate for where they are at\ndevelopmentally, for their better good.\nSo
    that they grow up to be ordered, to be competent, to be self-controlled, and\nto
    not grow up to be wild adults with no regard for boundaries and rules.</p>\n<p>So
    to be specific about the metaphor and the example I just laid out: I don't want
    my children\nto ever hurt or suffer, but I also know that suffering is required
    for learning and for them to grow to be mature individuals.\nI know how to control
    some of the inevitable suffering a child must endure, especially if it's in the
    form of discipline, for my children so they are safe, protected, loved, but also
    corrected and molded into competent human beings.</p>\n<h3>The Kicker</h3>\n<p>Now
    would it be appropriate for my older daughter (who understands that suffering
    is required\nfor learning) would it be appropriate for her to look at my younger
    daughter and tell\nher, &quot;dad wants you to suffer&quot;?\nThat's tough, isn't
    it...\nBecause she's not really lying, but more importantly she's also not telling
    anything close to the whole\ntruth and she is also not talking to somebody who
    is capable of understanding the nuances\nof that truth.</p>\n<p>In the eyes of
    God, I'm still a five-year-old.</p>\n<p>And for me as a five-year-old boy in the
    eyes of the Lord, to try and explain things that\nI think I understand or that
    I understand to the best capability that a five-year-old can -\nIf I go try to
    teach a three-year-old things about God in ways that they can't understand,\nI
    am not loving that other person and I'm not even loving God very well.\nI'm just
    stuck in my own arrogance of understanding, thinking that I now get it because
    I've come\nto my own realization.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I recognize there's a
    little irony now in writing this post because I'm\nsaying I think I kind of understand
    that I don't/can't understand the sovereignty\nand free will relationship. I wouldn't
    say I can explain that away, but I\nthink I understand who I am better in the
    eyes of the Lord and what I could\nreasonably expect to understand from an academic
    standpoint.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"so-what\">So What? <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    theological background have very simple ideas and\nunderstandings of free will
    and God's sovereignty.\nThey typically equate God's sovereignty with &quot;He
    willed everything to be, and so you don't\nactually have any real choices.&quot;\nThen
    they think that because God has ultimate sovereignty, but they have free will,
    they\ncan somehow contradict God's will, but then they don't understand that that
    is a violation\nof the doctrine of God's sovereignty.\nSo those conversations
    are typically hard to sit through, and my historical thought\non that, ever since
    I believe I've come to a pretty mature position on the matter,\nhas been that
    in the Hebrew mind, these things aren't at odds, and we create the division with
    our\nWestern ideals on what it means to make choices, and what it means to be
    free.</p>\n<h3>Freedom</h3>\n<p>As a quick parenthetical remark on that - freedom
    is not doing whatever you want.\nTrue freedom is living in accordance with your
    creation, bound by the things that create\norder, because it is within those boundaries
    that you were designed to live -\nand thus the life you live within the boundaries
    is the best the life could\nbe... Freedom isn't the ultimate goal, it's a byproduct
    of living in accordance\nwith our design.\nWhen you break those boundaries though
    - then life is scary, and you are not\nfree but rather a slave to the environment
    you made for yourself - an\nenvironment not designed for you because you designed
    it for yourself, it isn't\nwhat the Maker made for you</p>\n<h3>Freedom - Child's
    Play</h3>\n<p>An easy example is kids on a playground.\nIf you give a bunch of
    little kids a playground with nice high fences, and you tell them to\ndo whatever
    they want in the playground, they'll have a great time.\nBut if you take all the
    fences away from that playground, maybe even move it\nout further away from the
    school, kids tend to feel a lot less safe.\nBecause now, not only can they just
    wander as far away from it as they please, perhaps\nby accident, but dangers can
    now enter their playground... The fences gave them\nthe freedom to enjoy the life
    appropriate for them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"back-to-the-debate\">Back To the Debate <a

    and free will discussion...\nWith no academic, theological, or honestly even critical
    thinking\napplied, we have this very silly juxtaposition of sovereignty - as if
    it means\nyou can't make choices - and free will as if God's sovereignty could
    be usurped\nby us.\nHowever, in groups where we have more theological training
    present, we really just have the\nsame (directionally speaking - the same) conversation,
    with a larger vocabulary.\nNow we have words like &quot;agency&quot;, and &quot;scope
    of choice&quot;, things that kind of seek to explain\naway the tension by introducing
    new dimension or element of abstraction to the argument.</p>\n<p>At the end of
    the day, we're now just cutting the cake into smaller pieces.\nWe're just filling
    in some of the gaps that we can see.\nThere's still nuance.\nThere's still the
    Western influence of needing to label everything.\nThere's still, in my opinion,
    the ancient truth that in the Hebrew mind, Yahweh's sovereignty\nand the human's
    choice to live their life are not at odds with each other.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-new-perspective\">A

    I started to formulate just recently...</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">a recent thought</p>\n<p>Even for a PhD in theological
    studies or in theology or an expert in church history or\nchurch fathers or whatever
    - for somebody <em>today</em> to think that we can define these terms\nin a totally
    correct and understandable way is another manifestation of the\n<strong>PEAK ARROGANCE</strong>
    of the West  (Blog on Western v Eastern medicine in the works)</p>\n</div>\n<p>I
    don't mean to claim here that I have the <em>right</em> understanding of sovereignty
    and free will.\nBut Paul has some choice words for believers who love quarreling
    and debates, and he calls\nthem spiritual children who aren't ready for real food.</p>\n<div
    class=\"admonition source\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">2 Timothy 2:23-24</p>\n<p>23
    But reject foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they breed quarrels.\n24
    The Lord's slave must not quarrel, but must be gentle to everyone, able to teach,
    and patient,</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition source\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">1
    Corinthians 3</p>\n<p>1For my part, brothers and sisters, I was not able to speak
    to you as spiritual\npeople but as people of the flesh, as babies in Christ.a
    2I gave you milk to\ndrink, not solid food, since you were not yet ready for it.
    In fact, you are\nstill not ready, 3because you are still worldly. For since there
    is envya and\nstrifea b among you, are you not worldly and behaving like mere
    humans? 4For\nwhenever someone says, \u201CI belong to Paul,\u201D and another,
    \u201CI belong to Apollos,\u201Da</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"admonition warning\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">It's you</p>\n<p>I've often heard the Corinthian church
    used as an example of a bad place to\nbe - and no doubt it was. But modern American
    Christianity may be much closer\nto Corinth than Thessolinca as far as maturity
    and Christ-like living goes.</p>\n</div>\n<p>He says things like &quot;I gave
    you milk to drink, not solid food, since you were\nnot yet ready for it&quot;\nI
    used to think that the &quot;real food&quot; was these theological debates, that
    you learn\nmore about the Bible, you learn more about humanity, and then you can
    have these more\nin-depth conversations.\nBut I think the real wisdom is easly
    seen with a metaphor</p>\n<h3>Who's the child here?</h3>\n<p>I have two daughters
    in different developmental stages, and so we have 3 characters...\nThere's my
    young daughter, my older daughter, and me.\nRight away, I think we often talk
    about knowing God in this kind of a term where,\nyou know, I'm his child and I
    have children.\nSo there's a parent-child relationship.\nAnd then in the God-human
    relationship, I understand my position better now as a parent\nof real children,
    of humans, which helps me understand my position as a child of God.</p>\n<div
    class=\"admonition failure\">\n<p>I don't think we take that very seriously.</p>\n</div>\n<div
    class=\"admonition success\">\n<p>I think use this more as comforting language
    rather than a humbling truth - <strong>I'm a child of God</strong>\nBut really,
    I think the TLDR is that even the most highly trained theological individual -
    that person is not a grown-up in the eyes of God.\nHe or she is still a child,
    and our understanding is still limited to what a child can understand.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Let's
    continue with the metaphor...</p>\n<p>You could ask either one of my daughters
    if they know me, and of course they would both\nsay yes, and they know me to different
    degrees.\nPerhaps because the older one knows more about me - does that mean that
    she knows me better than the younger?\nI think it would be silly to say yes.\nBoth
    of my kids know me to the fullest capacity that they can know me.\nSo what about
    love?\nDo they both love me?\nAnd do I love them?\nOf course.\nAnd do I show my
    love to both of them in the same ways?\nOf course not.\nNot only are they unique,
    but they're at different stages in life...</p>\n<p>For example - I don't exercise
    the same amount of discipline towards my\nyoungest because she's not ready for
    it - it's not reasonable to expect the\nsame things of her as our older daughter.\nSpeaking
    of her - she absolutely is ready for some more discipline and for some\nhigher
    expectations, and so I will train her up in the ways that she is mature\nenough
    to understand.\nNow, does that mean I love my younger daughter less, or does it
    mean I love my older daughter\nmore?\nNo.\nIt means I'm loving them in a way that
    is appropriate for where they are at\ndevelopmentally, for their better good.\nSo
    that they grow up to be ordered, to be competent, to be self-controlled, and\nto
    not grow up to be wild adults with no regard for boundaries and rules.</p>\n<p>So
    to be specific about the metaphor and the example I just laid out: I don't want
    my children\nto ever hurt or suffer, but I also know that suffering is required
    for learning and for them to grow to be mature individuals.\nI know how to control
    some of the inevitable suffering a child must endure, especially if it's in the
    form of discipline, for my children so they are safe, protected, loved, but also
    corrected and molded into competent human beings.</p>\n<h3>The Kicker</h3>\n<p>Now
    would it be appropriate for my older daughter (who understands that suffering
    is required\nfor learning) would it be appropriate for her to look at my younger
    daughter and tell\nher, &quot;dad wants you to suffer&quot;?\nThat's tough, isn't
    it...\nBecause she's not really lying, but more importantly she's also not telling
    anything close to the whole\ntruth and she is also not talking to somebody who
    is capable of understanding the nuances\nof that truth.</p>\n<p>In the eyes of
    God, I'm still a five-year-old.</p>\n<p>And for me as a five-year-old boy in the
    eyes of the Lord, to try and explain things that\nI think I understand or that
    I understand to the best capability that a five-year-old can -\nIf I go try to
    teach a three-year-old things about God in ways that they can't understand,\nI
    am not loving that other person and I'm not even loving God very well.\nI'm just
    stuck in my own arrogance of understanding, thinking that I now get it because
    I've come\nto my own realization.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I recognize there's a
    little irony now in writing this post because I'm\nsaying I think I kind of understand
    that I don't/can't understand the sovereignty\nand free will relationship. I wouldn't
    say I can explain that away, but I\nthink I understand who I am better in the
    eyes of the Lord and what I could\nreasonably expect to understand from an academic
    standpoint.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"so-what\">So What? <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    theological background have very simple ideas and\nunderstandings of free will
    and God's sovereignty.\nThey typically equate God's sovereignty with &quot;He
    willed everything to be, and so you don't\nactually have any real choices.&quot;\nThen
    they think that because God has ultimate sovereignty, but they have free will,
    they\ncan somehow contradict God's will, but then they don't understand that that
    is a violation\nof the doctrine of God's sovereignty.\nSo those conversations
    are typically hard to sit through, and my historical thought\non that, ever since
    I believe I've come to a pretty mature position on the matter,\nhas been that
    in the Hebrew mind, these things aren't at odds, and we create the division with
    our\nWestern ideals on what it means to make choices, and what it means to be
    free.</p>\n<h3>Freedom</h3>\n<p>As a quick parenthetical remark on that - freedom
    is not doing whatever you want.\nTrue freedom is living in accordance with your
    creation, bound by the things that create\norder, because it is within those boundaries
    that you were designed to live -\nand thus the life you live within the boundaries
    is the best the life could\nbe... Freedom isn't the ultimate goal, it's a byproduct
    of living in accordance\nwith our design.\nWhen you break those boundaries though
    - then life is scary, and you are not\nfree but rather a slave to the environment
    you made for yourself - an\nenvironment not designed for you because you designed
    it for yourself, it isn't\nwhat the Maker made for you</p>\n<h3>Freedom - Child's
    Play</h3>\n<p>An easy example is kids on a playground.\nIf you give a bunch of
    little kids a playground with nice high fences, and you tell them to\ndo whatever
    they want in the playground, they'll have a great time.\nBut if you take all the
    fences away from that playground, maybe even move it\nout further away from the
    school, kids tend to feel a lot less safe.\nBecause now, not only can they just
    wander as far away from it as they please, perhaps\nby accident, but dangers can
    now enter their playground... The fences gave them\nthe freedom to enjoy the life
    appropriate for them.</p>\n<h2 id=\"back-to-the-debate\">Back To the Debate <a

    and free will discussion...\nWith no academic, theological, or honestly even critical
    thinking\napplied, we have this very silly juxtaposition of sovereignty - as if
    it means\nyou can't make choices - and free will as if God's sovereignty could
    be usurped\nby us.\nHowever, in groups where we have more theological training
    present, we really just have the\nsame (directionally speaking - the same) conversation,
    with a larger vocabulary.\nNow we have words like &quot;agency&quot;, and &quot;scope
    of choice&quot;, things that kind of seek to explain\naway the tension by introducing
    new dimension or element of abstraction to the argument.</p>\n<p>At the end of
    the day, we're now just cutting the cake into smaller pieces.\nWe're just filling
    in some of the gaps that we can see.\nThere's still nuance.\nThere's still the
    Western influence of needing to label everything.\nThere's still, in my opinion,
    the ancient truth that in the Hebrew mind, Yahweh's sovereignty\nand the human's
    choice to live their life are not at odds with each other.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-new-perspective\">A

    In fact, you are\nstill not ready, 3because you are still worldly. For since there

    class=\"admonition-title\">It's you</p>\n<p>I've often heard the Corinthian church
    used as an example of a bad place to\nbe - and no doubt it was. But modern American
    Christianity may be much closer\nto Corinth than Thessolinca as far as maturity
    and Christ-like living goes.</p>\n</div>\n<p>He says things like &quot;I gave
    you milk to drink, not solid food, since you were\nnot yet ready for it&quot;\nI
    used to think that the &quot;real food&quot; was these theological debates, that
    you learn\nmore about the Bible, you learn more about humanity, and then you can
    have these more\nin-depth conversations.\nBut I think the real wisdom is easly
    seen with a metaphor</p>\n<h3>Who's the child here?</h3>\n<p>I have two daughters
    in different developmental stages, and so we have 3 characters...\nThere's my
    young daughter, my older daughter, and me.\nRight away, I think we often talk
    about knowing God in this kind of a term where,\nyou know, I'm his child and I
    have children.\nSo there's a parent-child relationship.\nAnd then in the God-human
    relationship, I understand my position better now as a parent\nof real children,
    of humans, which helps me understand my position as a child of God.</p>\n<div
    class=\"admonition failure\">\n<p>I don't think we take that very seriously.</p>\n</div>\n<div
    class=\"admonition success\">\n<p>I think use this more as comforting language
    rather than a humbling truth - <strong>I'm a child of God</strong>\nBut really,
    I think the TLDR is that even the most highly trained theological individual -
    that person is not a grown-up in the eyes of God.\nHe or she is still a child,
    and our understanding is still limited to what a child can understand.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Let's
    continue with the metaphor...</p>\n<p>You could ask either one of my daughters
    if they know me, and of course they would both\nsay yes, and they know me to different
    degrees.\nPerhaps because the older one knows more about me - does that mean that
    she knows me better than the younger?\nI think it would be silly to say yes.\nBoth
    of my kids know me to the fullest capacity that they can know me.\nSo what about
    love?\nDo they both love me?\nAnd do I love them?\nOf course.\nAnd do I show my
    love to both of them in the same ways?\nOf course not.\nNot only are they unique,
    but they're at different stages in life...</p>\n<p>For example - I don't exercise
    the same amount of discipline towards my\nyoungest because she's not ready for
    it - it's not reasonable to expect the\nsame things of her as our older daughter.\nSpeaking
    of her - she absolutely is ready for some more discipline and for some\nhigher
    expectations, and so I will train her up in the ways that she is mature\nenough
    to understand.\nNow, does that mean I love my younger daughter less, or does it
    mean I love my older daughter\nmore?\nNo.\nIt means I'm loving them in a way that
    is appropriate for where they are at\ndevelopmentally, for their better good.\nSo
    that they grow up to be ordered, to be competent, to be self-controlled, and\nto
    not grow up to be wild adults with no regard for boundaries and rules.</p>\n<p>So
    to be specific about the metaphor and the example I just laid out: I don't want

    \ - sovereignty\ncover: \"https://cdn.statically.io/gh/pypeaday/images.pype.dev/main/blog-media/20250614184824_22e1d8af.png\"\n\n---\n\n##
    Intro\n\nI was in men's group the other day, and one of the things that came up
    almost inevitably\nis a debate between God's sovereignty and predestination, and
    then an idea of free will.\nI have been a part of these conversations for years
    - I've been in hundreds of them certainly,\nand they all go in a very similar
    direction. Almost irrespective of the theological prowess\nor training of the
    group of people I'm in the unspoken goal always is the same... \n**to find a hard
    and fast line between the 2 things or to find some comfortable verbiage for the
    tension**\n\n## My Anecdotal Experience With Other Believers\n\nPeople with no
    real theological background have very simple ideas and\nunderstandings of free
    will and God's sovereignty.\nThey typically equate God's sovereignty with \"He
    willed everything to be, and so you don't\nactually have any real choices.\"\nThen
    they think that because God has ultimate sovereignty, but they have free will,
    they\ncan somehow contradict God's will, but then they don't understand that that
    is a violation\nof the doctrine of God's sovereignty.\nSo those conversations
    are typically hard to sit through, and my historical thought\non that, ever since
    I believe I've come to a pretty mature position on the matter,\nhas been that
    in the Hebrew mind, these things aren't at odds, and we create the division with
    our\nWestern ideals on what it means to make choices, and what it means to be
    free.\n\n### Freedom\n\nAs a quick parenthetical remark on that - freedom is not
    doing whatever you want.\nTrue freedom is living in accordance with your creation,
    bound by the things that create\norder, because it is within those boundaries
    that you were designed to live -\nand thus the life you live within the boundaries
    is the best the life could\nbe... Freedom isn't the ultimate goal, it's a byproduct
    of living in accordance\nwith our design.\nWhen you break those boundaries though
    - then life is scary, and you are not\nfree but rather a slave to the environment
    you made for yourself - an\nenvironment not designed for you because you designed
    it for yourself, it isn't\nwhat the Maker made for you\n\n### Freedom - Child's
    Play\n\nAn easy example is kids on a playground.\nIf you give a bunch of little
    kids a playground with nice high fences, and you tell them to\ndo whatever they
    want in the playground, they'll have a great time.\nBut if you take all the fences
    away from that playground, maybe even move it\nout further away from the school,
    kids tend to feel a lot less safe.\nBecause now, not only can they just wander
    as far away from it as they please, perhaps\nby accident, but dangers can now
    enter their playground... The fences gave them\nthe freedom to enjoy the life
    appropriate for them.\n\n## Back To the Debate\n\nReturning to the sovereignty
    and free will discussion... \nWith no academic, theological, or honestly even
    critical thinking\napplied, we have this very silly juxtaposition of sovereignty
    - as if it means\nyou can't make choices - and free will as if God's sovereignty
    could be usurped\nby us.\nHowever, in groups where we have more theological training
    present, we really just have the\nsame (directionally speaking - the same) conversation,
    with a larger vocabulary.\nNow we have words like \"agency\", and \"scope of choice\",
    things that kind of seek to explain\naway the tension by introducing new dimension
    or element of abstraction to the argument.\n\nAt the end of the day, we're now
    just cutting the cake into smaller pieces.\nWe're just filling in some of the
    gaps that we can see.\nThere's still nuance.\nThere's still the Western influence
    of needing to label everything.\nThere's still, in my opinion, the ancient truth
    that in the Hebrew mind, Yahweh's sovereignty\nand the human's choice to live
    their life are not at odds with each other.\n\n## A New Perspective\n\nBut here's
    a thought I started to formulate just recently...\n\n!!! note a recent thought\n
    \   Even for a PhD in theological studies or in theology or an expert in church
    history or\n    church fathers or whatever - for somebody _today_ to think that
    we can define these terms \n    in a totally correct and understandable way is
    another manifestation of the\n    __PEAK ARROGANCE__ of the West  (Blog on Western
    v Eastern medicine in the works)\n\nI don't mean to claim here that I have the
    _right_ understanding of sovereignty and free will.\nBut Paul has some choice
    words for believers who love quarreling and debates, and he calls\nthem spiritual
    children who aren't ready for real food.\n\n!!! source 2 Timothy 2:23-24\n\n    23
    But reject foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they breed quarrels.\n
    \   24 The Lord's slave must not quarrel, but must be gentle to everyone, able
    to teach, and patient,\n\n!!! source 1 Corinthians 3\n    1For my part, brothers
    and sisters, I was not able to speak to you as spiritual\n    people but as people
    of the flesh, as babies in Christ.a 2I gave you milk to\n    drink, not solid
    food, since you were not yet ready for it. In fact, you are\n    still not ready,
    3because you are still worldly. For since there is envya and\n    strifea b among
    you, are you not worldly and behaving like mere humans? 4For\n    whenever someone
    says, \u201CI belong to Paul,\u201D and another, \u201CI belong to Apollos,\u201Da\n\n!!!
    warning It's you\n    I've often heard the Corinthian church used as an example
    of a bad place to\n    be - and no doubt it was. But modern American Christianity
    may be much closer\n    to Corinth than Thessolinca as far as maturity and Christ-like
    living goes.\n\nHe says things like \"I gave you milk to drink, not solid food,
    since you were\nnot yet ready for it\"\nI used to think that the \"real food\"
    was these theological debates, that you learn\nmore about the Bible, you learn
    more about humanity, and then you can have these more\nin-depth conversations.\nBut
    I think the real wisdom is easly seen with a metaphor\n\n### Who's the child here?\n\nI
    have two daughters in different developmental stages, and so we have 3 characters...\nThere's
    my young daughter, my older daughter, and me.\nRight away, I think we often talk
    about knowing God in this kind of a term where,\nyou know, I'm his child and I
    have children.\nSo there's a parent-child relationship.\nAnd then in the God-human
    relationship, I understand my position better now as a parent\nof real children,
    of humans, which helps me understand my position as a child of God.\n\n!!! failure
    \"\"\n    I don't think we take that very seriously.\n\n!!! success \"\"\n    I
    think use this more as comforting language rather than a humbling truth - __I'm
    a child of God__\n    But really, I think the TLDR is that even the most highly
    trained theological individual - that person is not a grown-up in the eyes of
    God.\n    He or she is still a child, and our understanding is still limited to
    what a child can understand.\n\nLet's continue with the metaphor...\n\nYou could
    ask either one of my daughters if they know me, and of course they would both\nsay
    yes, and they know me to different degrees.\nPerhaps because the older one knows
    more about me - does that mean that she knows me better than the younger?\nI think
    it would be silly to say yes.\nBoth of my kids know me to the fullest capacity
    that they can know me.\nSo what about love?\nDo they both love me?\nAnd do I love
    them?\nOf course.\nAnd do I show my love to both of them in the same ways?\nOf
    course not.\nNot only are they unique, but they're at different stages in life...
    \n\nFor example - I don't exercise the same amount of discipline towards my\nyoungest
    because she's not ready for it - it's not reasonable to expect the\nsame things
    of her as our older daughter.\nSpeaking of her - she absolutely is ready for some
    more discipline and for some\nhigher expectations, and so I will train her up
    in the ways that she is mature\nenough to understand.\nNow, does that mean I love
    my younger daughter less, or does it mean I love my older daughter\nmore?\nNo.\nIt
    means I'm loving them in a way that is appropriate for where they are at\ndevelopmentally,
    for their better good.\nSo that they grow up to be ordered, to be competent, to
    be self-controlled, and\nto not grow up to be wild adults with no regard for boundaries
    and rules.\n\nSo to be specific about the metaphor and the example I just laid
    out: I don't want my children\nto ever hurt or suffer, but I also know that suffering
    is required for learning and for them to grow to be mature individuals.\nI know
    how to control some of the inevitable suffering a child must endure, especially
    if it's in the form of discipline, for my children so they are safe, protected,

**to find a hard and fast line between the 2 things or to find some comfortable verbiage for the tension**

People with no real theological background have very simple ideas and

So those conversations are typically hard to sit through, and my historical thought

has been that in the Hebrew mind, these things aren't at odds, and we create the division with our
Western ideals on what it means to make choices, and what it means to be free.

### Freedom

As a quick parenthetical remark on that - freedom is not doing whatever you want.
True freedom is living in accordance with your creation, bound by the things that create

and thus the life you live within the boundaries is the best the life could

Because now, not only can they just wander as far away from it as they please, perhaps
by accident, but dangers can now enter their playground... The fences gave them
the freedom to enjoy the life appropriate for them.

## Back To the Debate

Returning to the sovereignty and free will discussion... 
With no academic, theological, or honestly even critical thinking
applied, we have this very silly juxtaposition of sovereignty - as if it means
you can't make choices - and free will as if God's sovereignty could be usurped
by us.
However, in groups where we have more theological training present, we really just have the
same (directionally speaking - the same) conversation, with a larger vocabulary.
Now we have words like "agency", and "scope of choice", things that kind of seek to explain
away the tension by introducing new dimension or element of abstraction to the argument.

At the end of the day, we're now just cutting the cake into smaller pieces.
We're just filling in some of the gaps that we can see.
There's still nuance.
There's still the Western influence of needing to label everything.
There's still, in my opinion, the ancient truth that in the Hebrew mind, Yahweh's sovereignty
and the human's choice to live their life are not at odds with each other.

## A New Perspective

But here's a thought I started to formulate just recently...

!!! note a recent thought
    Even for a PhD in theological studies or in theology or an expert in church history or
    church fathers or whatever - for somebody _today_ to think that we can define these terms 
    in a totally correct and understandable way is another manifestation of the
    __PEAK ARROGANCE__ of the West  (Blog on Western v Eastern medicine in the works)

I don't mean to claim here that I have the _right_ understanding of sovereignty and free will.
But Paul has some choice words for believers who love quarreling and debates, and he calls
them spiritual children who aren't ready for real food.

!!! source 2 Timothy 2:23-24

    23 But reject foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they breed quarrels.
    24 The Lord's slave must not quarrel, but must be gentle to everyone, able to teach, and patient,

!!! source 1 Corinthians 3
    1For my part, brothers and sisters, I was not able to speak to you as spiritual
    people but as people of the flesh, as babies in Christ.a 2I gave you milk to
    drink, not solid food, since you were not yet ready for it. In fact, you are
    still not ready, 3because you are still worldly. For since there is envya and
    strifea b among you, are you not worldly and behaving like mere humans? 4For
    whenever someone says, “I belong to Paul,” and another, “I belong to Apollos,”a

!!! warning It's you
    I've often heard the Corinthian church used as an example of a bad place to
    be - and no doubt it was. But modern American Christianity may be much closer
    to Corinth than Thessolinca as far as maturity and Christ-like living goes.

He says things like "I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, since you were
not yet ready for it"
I used to think that the "real food" was these theological debates, that you learn
more about the Bible, you learn more about humanity, and then you can have these more
in-depth conversations.
But I think the real wisdom is easly seen with a metaphor

### Who's the child here?

I have two daughters in different developmental stages, and so we have 3 characters...
There's my young daughter, my older daughter, and me.
Right away, I think we often talk about knowing God in this kind of a term where,
you know, I'm his child and I have children.
So there's a parent-child relationship.
And then in the God-human relationship, I understand my position better now as a parent
of real children, of humans, which helps me understand my position as a child of God.

!!! failure ""
    I don't think we take that very seriously.

!!! success ""
    I think use this more as comforting language rather than a humbling truth - __I'm a child of God__
    But really, I think the TLDR is that even the most highly trained theological individual - that person is not a grown-up in the eyes of God.
    He or she is still a child, and our understanding is still limited to what a child can understand.

Let's continue with the metaphor...

You could ask either one of my daughters if they know me, and of course they would both
say yes, and they know me to different degrees.
Perhaps because the older one knows more about me - does that mean that she knows me better than the younger?
I think it would be silly to say yes.
Both of my kids know me to the fullest capacity that they can know me.
So what about love?
Do they both love me?
And do I love them?
Of course.
And do I show my love to both of them in the same ways?
Of course not.
Not only are they unique, but they're at different stages in life... 

For example - I don't exercise the same amount of discipline towards my
youngest because she's not ready for it - it's not reasonable to expect the
same things of her as our older daughter.
Speaking of her - she absolutely is ready for some more discipline and for some
higher expectations, and so I will train her up in the ways that she is mature
enough to understand.
Now, does that mean I love my younger daughter less, or does it mean I love my older daughter
more?
No.
It means I'm loving them in a way that is appropriate for where they are at
developmentally, for their better good.
So that they grow up to be ordered, to be competent, to be self-controlled, and
to not grow up to be wild adults with no regard for boundaries and rules.

So to be specific about the metaphor and the example I just laid out: I don't want my children
to ever hurt or suffer, but I also know that suffering is required for learning and for them to grow to be mature individuals.
I know how to control some of the inevitable suffering a child must endure, especially if it's in the form of discipline, for my children so they are safe, protected, loved, but also corrected and molded into competent human beings.

### The Kicker

Now would it be appropriate for my older daughter (who understands that suffering is required
for learning) would it be appropriate for her to look at my younger daughter and tell
her, "dad wants you to suffer"?
That's tough, isn't it...
Because she's not really lying, but more importantly she's also not telling anything close to the whole
truth and she is also not talking to somebody who is capable of understanding the nuances
of that truth.

In the eyes of God, I'm still a five-year-old.

And for me as a five-year-old boy in the eyes of the Lord, to try and explain things that
I think I understand or that I understand to the best capability that a five-year-old can -
If I go try to teach a three-year-old things about God in ways that they can't understand,
I am not loving that other person and I'm not even loving God very well.
I'm just stuck in my own arrogance of understanding, thinking that I now get it because I've come
to my own realization.

## So What?

The lesson for me, and for my community of faith - is to calm down about the
debates.... They're fun over a drink and cigars, but when boots are on the
ground we need to remember that the Bible has information that we need to know,
it doesn't have all the information that we want to know - and the American
Church must drop its arrogant need to explain away every mystery and instead
hold fast to the God of those mysteries.
