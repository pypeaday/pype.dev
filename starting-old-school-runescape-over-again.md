  with my PS4 and\nmy PC I decided to go old school literally with Old School Runescape...
  I\nplayed this game so much as a kid and it's so well preserved in 2025. I tried\nto
  bang out a ton today and decided to look through a few guides to try to\nlevel up
  effeciently. \n\n## Quests\n\nThere's a handful of quests and several are pretty
  attainable early on that\ngive enough XP to blitz through the early levels of many
  skills...\n\nToday I made it through doric's quest which bumped be\nthrough to level
  20+ mining. Another player gave me a black pick-axe which made\nmining some iron
  pretty easy. From there I wanted to level up smithing a bit -\nand the guides say
  that \"The Knight's Sword\" is a good quest for it, though\nit's recommended to
  be combat level 20 before doing it... I decided to not\nworry about that, I've picked
  red-berries for a pie and am going to bring a\nhaul of steaks and my black pick
  while I try to get the bluerite ore and run\naway from the ice giants that I know
  will destroy me at my whopping combat\nlevel 6... but for first day back I'm feeling
  great.\n\nAfter that my smithing levels should be in the teens... Not sure what
  we'll do after that\n\nI did do the Cook's Assistant while gathering things for
  the Knight's Sword,\neasy peasy and gets me access to the oven in Lumbridge Castle.\n\n##
  Plans\n\nI'm using Affine to map out my questing - the mind map is great for tracking\nwhy
  I'm 6 mini-side-quests removed from the original thing I was after.\n\n![20250815003021_4a18defc.png](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/pypeaday/images.pype.dev/main/blog-media/20250815003021_4a18defc.png)\n\n##
  Update 01\n\nAfter about 2 weeks I've done most of othe free-to-play stuff, with
  just\nanother 2 quests to go. The game is so faitful to what I remember.\n\nI was
  thinking about how I would tackle a new account, and I am starting to\nunderstand
  the simple appeal of having alternate accounts - a \"pure mage\" for\nexample....
  If money were no object then having a pure ranger and mage account\nwould be pretty
  fun, and with a powerful main I think it's possible to make\nplenty of in-game gold
  and just trade between accounts. To my knowledge, this\ndoesn't break any of the
  Jagex rules.\n\nPutting the idea of a \"pure\" anything aside, I was thinking about
  how I would\nmore efficiently have played to the point in the game I'm at right
  now... For\ngaining any combat xp the goal is the `rune scimitar`, which requires
  level 40\n`attack` to wield. The stronger you are (ie. higher `strength`) the more
  xp you\ncan gain per second. This means upping `attack` to level 40 with the best\nscimitar
  you can at every level until `rune` at 40, and then swapping to the\nstrength-gaining
  combat style and theoretically training `strength` to level 99,\nand then train
  `defense` and `attack` from `x` and `40` respectively to `99` is\nthe quickest way
  to do it.\n\nThe issue with this is that due to the level-scaling of the game, it's
  totally\nimpractical to do this and would suck all the fun out of the game. I think
  I\nhandled my melee combat leveling pretty well by keeping the 3 stats, `attack`,\n`strength`,
  `defense` more or less in step with each other up to 40, and from\nthen on began
  focusing primarily on `strength`.\n\nI've also spent plenty of time on `ranged`
  and `magic` but these are expensive\nto train quickly (and quickly isn't even THAT
  fast) due to resource consumption\n(arrows / runes). Now, I have plenty of resources
  in game, so training these\nhas been fine, but in a more vanilla situation they
  could mostly be forgotten\nabout until you've leveled up in `crafting` or `mining`
  and `smithing` for the\nsake of making some money.\n\nOn that note, combat can be
  paused from the onset and one can jump right to the\nmines with tin + copper ->
  iron or else tan cowhides and craft leather...\neither way, upgrading these skills
  opens the door for money-making routines and\nif you have a good source of income
  in the game, then buying runes and arrows\nfor training is quite simple at the `grand
  exchange`\n\nThere are a few guides on the \"optimal\" way to play through the game
  depending\non what you want to optimize. Personally, upon thinking about it through
  writing I can\nsee how there's not a \"one right way\" to play the game \"most efficiently\".\n\nIf
  I were to start another account, not as one of these fancy schmancy \"pure\"\nones,
  I think I would train my melee stats to 40 via cows, chickens, and giant\nfrogs
  (then doubling up on prayer via `big bones`). The reason for this is that\nthere's
  places to mine and fish where the enemies are in level ranges 20-30 and\nit's convenient
  to avoid hostility (ie. being attacked on site)\n(south-east varrock mine for example
  isn't NEXT to the dark wizards, but they\nare close and if you are sub combat level
  21 or something, they are hostile\ntowards you).\n\nThe other skills I hadn't thought
  about from the perspective of a guide are\nfiremaking, fishing, cooking, and woodcutting.
  Typically they're pretty easy to\ntrain together, but it's also really easy to focus
  on cooking by itself east of\nBarbarian Village where folks are trainign fishing
  by just dropping raw fish.\nCoincidentally, that's one of the fastest ways to level
  up fishing as well...\n\nI've played the game these last 2 weeks I see that with
  enough money in the\ngame you are better off staying laser-focused on one skill
  at a time and then\nbuying the resoures needed for the other skills. For example,
  you can train\ncombat and prayer with giant frogs pretty effeciently since they
  drop `big\nbones`. But it's faster to just focus on killing the frogs for melee
  xp, and\nthen buying big bones to do focused bone-burying sessions at a bank, is
  going\nto be a better use of time, but at the cost of buying the bones instead of\nharvesting
  yourself. If you resign youself to this pattern of play, the game\npace moves a
  little quicker, the grind isn't so exhausting, and the enjoyment\nis a big lighter
  (in a good way)"

    a new game recently and after squabbling with my PS4 and\nmy PC I decided to go
    old school literally with Old School Runescape... I\nplayed this game so much
    as a kid and it's so well preserved in 2025. I tried\nto bang out a ton today
    and decided to look through a few guides to try to\nlevel up effeciently.</p>\n<h2

    quests and several are pretty attainable early on that\ngive enough XP to blitz
    through the early levels of many skills...</p>\n<p>Today I made it through doric's
    quest which bumped be\nthrough to level 20+ mining. Another player gave me a black
    pick-axe which made\nmining some iron pretty easy. From there I wanted to level
    up smithing a bit -\nand the guides say that &quot;The Knight's Sword&quot; is
    a good quest for it, though\nit's recommended to be combat level 20 before doing
    it... I decided to not\nworry about that, I've picked red-berries for a pie and
    am going to bring a\nhaul of steaks and my black pick while I try to get the bluerite
    ore and run\naway from the ice giants that I know will destroy me at my whopping
    combat\nlevel 6... but for first day back I'm feeling great.</p>\n<p>After that
    my smithing levels should be in the teens... Not sure what we'll do after that</p>\n<p>I
    did do the Cook's Assistant while gathering things for the Knight's Sword,\neasy
    peasy and gets me access to the oven in Lumbridge Castle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"plans\">Plans

    I've done most of othe free-to-play stuff, with just\nanother 2 quests to go.
    The game is so faitful to what I remember.</p>\n<p>I was thinking about how I
    would tackle a new account, and I am starting to\nunderstand the simple appeal
    of having alternate accounts - a &quot;pure mage&quot; for\nexample.... If money
    were no object then having a pure ranger and mage account\nwould be pretty fun,
    and with a powerful main I think it's possible to make\nplenty of in-game gold
    and just trade between accounts. To my knowledge, this\ndoesn't break any of the
    Jagex rules.</p>\n<p>Putting the idea of a &quot;pure&quot; anything aside, I
    was thinking about how I would\nmore efficiently have played to the point in the
    game I'm at right now... For\ngaining any combat xp the goal is the <code>rune
    scimitar</code>, which requires level 40\n<code>attack</code> to wield. The stronger
    you are (ie. higher <code>strength</code>) the more xp you\ncan gain per second.
    This means upping <code>attack</code> to level 40 with the best\nscimitar you
    can at every level until <code>rune</code> at 40, and then swapping to the\nstrength-gaining
    combat style and theoretically training <code>strength</code> to level 99,\nand
    then train <code>defense</code> and <code>attack</code> from <code>x</code> and
    <code>40</code> respectively to <code>99</code> is\nthe quickest way to do it.</p>\n<p>The
    issue with this is that due to the level-scaling of the game, it's totally\nimpractical
    to do this and would suck all the fun out of the game. I think I\nhandled my melee
    combat leveling pretty well by keeping the 3 stats, <code>attack</code>,\n<code>strength</code>,
    <code>defense</code> more or less in step with each other up to 40, and from\nthen
    on began focusing primarily on <code>strength</code>.</p>\n<p>I've also spent
    plenty of time on <code>ranged</code> and <code>magic</code> but these are expensive\nto
    train quickly (and quickly isn't even THAT fast) due to resource consumption\n(arrows
    / runes). Now, I have plenty of resources in game, so training these\nhas been
    fine, but in a more vanilla situation they could mostly be forgotten\nabout until
    you've leveled up in <code>crafting</code> or <code>mining</code> and <code>smithing</code>
    for the\nsake of making some money.</p>\n<p>On that note, combat can be paused
    from the onset and one can jump right to the\nmines with tin + copper -&gt; iron
    or else tan cowhides and craft leather...\neither way, upgrading these skills
    opens the door for money-making routines and\nif you have a good source of income
    in the game, then buying runes and arrows\nfor training is quite simple at the
    <code>grand exchange</code></p>\n<p>There are a few guides on the &quot;optimal&quot;
    way to play through the game depending\non what you want to optimize. Personally,
    upon thinking about it through writing I can\nsee how there's not a &quot;one
    right way&quot; to play the game &quot;most efficiently&quot;.</p>\n<p>If I were
    to start another account, not as one of these fancy schmancy &quot;pure&quot;\nones,
    I think I would train my melee stats to 40 via cows, chickens, and giant\nfrogs
    (then doubling up on prayer via <code>big bones</code>). The reason for this is
    that\nthere's places to mine and fish where the enemies are in level ranges 20-30
    and\nit's convenient to avoid hostility (ie. being attacked on site)\n(south-east
    varrock mine for example isn't NEXT to the dark wizards, but they\nare close and
    if you are sub combat level 21 or something, they are hostile\ntowards you).</p>\n<p>The
    other skills I hadn't thought about from the perspective of a guide are\nfiremaking,
    fishing, cooking, and woodcutting. Typically they're pretty easy to\ntrain together,
    but it's also really easy to focus on cooking by itself east of\nBarbarian Village
    where folks are trainign fishing by just dropping raw fish.\nCoincidentally, that's
    one of the fastest ways to level up fishing as well...</p>\n<p>I've played the
    game these last 2 weeks I see that with enough money in the\ngame you are better
    off staying laser-focused on one skill at a time and then\nbuying the resoures
    needed for the other skills. For example, you can train\ncombat and prayer with
    giant frogs pretty effeciently since they drop <code>big bones</code>. But it's
    faster to just focus on killing the frogs for melee xp, and\nthen buying big bones
    to do focused bone-burying sessions at a bank, is going\nto be a better use of
    time, but at the cost of buying the bones instead of\nharvesting yourself. If
    you resign youself to this pattern of play, the game\npace moves a little quicker,
    the grind isn't so exhausting, and the enjoyment\nis a big lighter (in a good
    way)</p>\n\n    </section>\n</article>        </div>\n    </main>\n\n</div>\n

    quests and several are pretty attainable early on that\ngive enough XP to blitz
    through the early levels of many skills...</p>\n<p>Today I made it through doric's
    quest which bumped be\nthrough to level 20+ mining. Another player gave me a black
    pick-axe which made\nmining some iron pretty easy. From there I wanted to level
    up smithing a bit -\nand the guides say that &quot;The Knight's Sword&quot; is
    a good quest for it, though\nit's recommended to be combat level 20 before doing
    it... I decided to not\nworry about that, I've picked red-berries for a pie and
    am going to bring a\nhaul of steaks and my black pick while I try to get the bluerite
    ore and run\naway from the ice giants that I know will destroy me at my whopping
    combat\nlevel 6... but for first day back I'm feeling great.</p>\n<p>After that
    my smithing levels should be in the teens... Not sure what we'll do after that</p>\n<p>I
    did do the Cook's Assistant while gathering things for the Knight's Sword,\neasy

    I've done most of othe free-to-play stuff, with just\nanother 2 quests to go.
    The game is so faitful to what I remember.</p>\n<p>I was thinking about how I
    would tackle a new account, and I am starting to\nunderstand the simple appeal
    of having alternate accounts - a &quot;pure mage&quot; for\nexample.... If money
    were no object then having a pure ranger and mage account\nwould be pretty fun,
    and with a powerful main I think it's possible to make\nplenty of in-game gold
    and just trade between accounts. To my knowledge, this\ndoesn't break any of the
    Jagex rules.</p>\n<p>Putting the idea of a &quot;pure&quot; anything aside, I
    was thinking about how I would\nmore efficiently have played to the point in the
    game I'm at right now... For\ngaining any combat xp the goal is the <code>rune
    scimitar</code>, which requires level 40\n<code>attack</code> to wield. The stronger
    you are (ie. higher <code>strength</code>) the more xp you\ncan gain per second.
    This means upping <code>attack</code> to level 40 with the best\nscimitar you
    can at every level until <code>rune</code> at 40, and then swapping to the\nstrength-gaining
    combat style and theoretically training <code>strength</code> to level 99,\nand
    then train <code>defense</code> and <code>attack</code> from <code>x</code> and
    <code>40</code> respectively to <code>99</code> is\nthe quickest way to do it.</p>\n<p>The
    issue with this is that due to the level-scaling of the game, it's totally\nimpractical
    to do this and would suck all the fun out of the game. I think I\nhandled my melee
    combat leveling pretty well by keeping the 3 stats, <code>attack</code>,\n<code>strength</code>,
    <code>defense</code> more or less in step with each other up to 40, and from\nthen
    on began focusing primarily on <code>strength</code>.</p>\n<p>I've also spent
    plenty of time on <code>ranged</code> and <code>magic</code> but these are expensive\nto
    train quickly (and quickly isn't even THAT fast) due to resource consumption\n(arrows
    / runes). Now, I have plenty of resources in game, so training these\nhas been
    fine, but in a more vanilla situation they could mostly be forgotten\nabout until
    you've leveled up in <code>crafting</code> or <code>mining</code> and <code>smithing</code>
    for the\nsake of making some money.</p>\n<p>On that note, combat can be paused
    from the onset and one can jump right to the\nmines with tin + copper -&gt; iron
    or else tan cowhides and craft leather...\neither way, upgrading these skills
    opens the door for money-making routines and\nif you have a good source of income
    in the game, then buying runes and arrows\nfor training is quite simple at the
    <code>grand exchange</code></p>\n<p>There are a few guides on the &quot;optimal&quot;
    way to play through the game depending\non what you want to optimize. Personally,
    upon thinking about it through writing I can\nsee how there's not a &quot;one
    right way&quot; to play the game &quot;most efficiently&quot;.</p>\n<p>If I were
    to start another account, not as one of these fancy schmancy &quot;pure&quot;\nones,
    I think I would train my melee stats to 40 via cows, chickens, and giant\nfrogs
    (then doubling up on prayer via <code>big bones</code>). The reason for this is
    that\nthere's places to mine and fish where the enemies are in level ranges 20-30
    and\nit's convenient to avoid hostility (ie. being attacked on site)\n(south-east
    varrock mine for example isn't NEXT to the dark wizards, but they\nare close and
    if you are sub combat level 21 or something, they are hostile\ntowards you).</p>\n<p>The
    other skills I hadn't thought about from the perspective of a guide are\nfiremaking,
    fishing, cooking, and woodcutting. Typically they're pretty easy to\ntrain together,
    but it's also really easy to focus on cooking by itself east of\nBarbarian Village
    where folks are trainign fishing by just dropping raw fish.\nCoincidentally, that's
    one of the fastest ways to level up fishing as well...</p>\n<p>I've played the
    game these last 2 weeks I see that with enough money in the\ngame you are better
    off staying laser-focused on one skill at a time and then\nbuying the resoures
    needed for the other skills. For example, you can train\ncombat and prayer with
    giant frogs pretty effeciently since they drop <code>big bones</code>. But it's
    faster to just focus on killing the frogs for melee xp, and\nthen buying big bones
    to do focused bone-burying sessions at a bank, is going\nto be a better use of
    time, but at the cost of buying the bones instead of\nharvesting yourself. If
    you resign youself to this pattern of play, the game\npace moves a little quicker,
    the grind isn't so exhausting, and the enjoyment\nis a big lighter (in a good
    way)</p>\n\n    </section>\n</article>"

    quests and several are pretty attainable early on that\ngive enough XP to blitz
    through the early levels of many skills...</p>\n<p>Today I made it through doric's
    quest which bumped be\nthrough to level 20+ mining. Another player gave me a black
    pick-axe which made\nmining some iron pretty easy. From there I wanted to level
    up smithing a bit -\nand the guides say that &quot;The Knight's Sword&quot; is
    a good quest for it, though\nit's recommended to be combat level 20 before doing
    it... I decided to not\nworry about that, I've picked red-berries for a pie and
    am going to bring a\nhaul of steaks and my black pick while I try to get the bluerite
    ore and run\naway from the ice giants that I know will destroy me at my whopping
    combat\nlevel 6... but for first day back I'm feeling great.</p>\n<p>After that
    my smithing levels should be in the teens... Not sure what we'll do after that</p>\n<p>I
    did do the Cook's Assistant while gathering things for the Knight's Sword,\neasy
    peasy and gets me access to the oven in Lumbridge Castle.</p>\n<h2 id=\"plans\">Plans

## Intro

I got an itch to play a new game recently and after squabbling with my PS4 and
my PC I decided to go old school literally with Old School Runescape... I
played this game so much as a kid and it's so well preserved in 2025. I tried
to bang out a ton today and decided to look through a few guides to try to
level up effeciently. 

## Quests

There's a handful of quests and several are pretty attainable early on that
give enough XP to blitz through the early levels of many skills...

Today I made it through doric's quest which bumped be
through to level 20+ mining. Another player gave me a black pick-axe which made
mining some iron pretty easy. From there I wanted to level up smithing a bit -
and the guides say that "The Knight's Sword" is a good quest for it, though
it's recommended to be combat level 20 before doing it... I decided to not
worry about that, I've picked red-berries for a pie and am going to bring a
haul of steaks and my black pick while I try to get the bluerite ore and run
away from the ice giants that I know will destroy me at my whopping combat
level 6... but for first day back I'm feeling great.

After that my smithing levels should be in the teens... Not sure what we'll do after that

I did do the Cook's Assistant while gathering things for the Knight's Sword,
easy peasy and gets me access to the oven in Lumbridge Castle.

## Plans

I'm using Affine to map out my questing - the mind map is great for tracking
why I'm 6 mini-side-quests removed from the original thing I was after.

## Update 01

After about 2 weeks I've done most of othe free-to-play stuff, with just
another 2 quests to go. The game is so faitful to what I remember.

I was thinking about how I would tackle a new account, and I am starting to
understand the simple appeal of having alternate accounts - a "pure mage" for
example.... If money were no object then having a pure ranger and mage account
would be pretty fun, and with a powerful main I think it's possible to make
plenty of in-game gold and just trade between accounts. To my knowledge, this
doesn't break any of the Jagex rules.

Putting the idea of a "pure" anything aside, I was thinking about how I would
more efficiently have played to the point in the game I'm at right now... For
gaining any combat xp the goal is the `rune scimitar`, which requires level 40
`attack` to wield. The stronger you are (ie. higher `strength`) the more xp you
can gain per second. This means upping `attack` to level 40 with the best
scimitar you can at every level until `rune` at 40, and then swapping to the
strength-gaining combat style and theoretically training `strength` to level 99,
and then train `defense` and `attack` from `x` and `40` respectively to `99` is
the quickest way to do it.

The issue with this is that due to the level-scaling of the game, it's totally
impractical to do this and would suck all the fun out of the game. I think I
handled my melee combat leveling pretty well by keeping the 3 stats, `attack`,
`strength`, `defense` more or less in step with each other up to 40, and from
then on began focusing primarily on `strength`.

I've also spent plenty of time on `ranged` and `magic` but these are expensive
to train quickly (and quickly isn't even THAT fast) due to resource consumption
(arrows / runes). Now, I have plenty of resources in game, so training these
has been fine, but in a more vanilla situation they could mostly be forgotten
about until you've leveled up in `crafting` or `mining` and `smithing` for the
sake of making some money.

On that note, combat can be paused from the onset and one can jump right to the
mines with tin + copper -> iron or else tan cowhides and craft leather...
either way, upgrading these skills opens the door for money-making routines and
if you have a good source of income in the game, then buying runes and arrows
for training is quite simple at the `grand exchange`

There are a few guides on the "optimal" way to play through the game depending
on what you want to optimize. Personally, upon thinking about it through writing I can
see how there's not a "one right way" to play the game "most efficiently".

If I were to start another account, not as one of these fancy schmancy "pure"
ones, I think I would train my melee stats to 40 via cows, chickens, and giant
frogs (then doubling up on prayer via `big bones`). The reason for this is that
there's places to mine and fish where the enemies are in level ranges 20-30 and
it's convenient to avoid hostility (ie. being attacked on site)
(south-east varrock mine for example isn't NEXT to the dark wizards, but they
are close and if you are sub combat level 21 or something, they are hostile
towards you).

The other skills I hadn't thought about from the perspective of a guide are
firemaking, fishing, cooking, and woodcutting. Typically they're pretty easy to
train together, but it's also really easy to focus on cooking by itself east of
Barbarian Village where folks are trainign fishing by just dropping raw fish.
Coincidentally, that's one of the fastest ways to level up fishing as well...

I've played the game these last 2 weeks I see that with enough money in the
game you are better off staying laser-focused on one skill at a time and then
buying the resoures needed for the other skills. For example, you can train
combat and prayer with giant frogs pretty effeciently since they drop `big
bones`. But it's faster to just focus on killing the frogs for melee xp, and
then buying big bones to do focused bone-burying sessions at a bank, is going
to be a better use of time, but at the cost of buying the bones instead of
harvesting yourself. If you resign youself to this pattern of play, the game
pace moves a little quicker, the grind isn't so exhausting, and the enjoyment
is a big lighter (in a good way)
