## Reflection

- didn't write one up today, mediated some more this morning on "inner man",
acknowledging the law with my mind, and the Sermon on the Mount whereby Jesus
teaches his disciples about a new kingdom, where doing right leads to reward -
but the definition of reward changes as we walk in step with Jesus

## Forgejo

- multiple runner, nice

## Github

- starred many things today
  - speakr looks nice for how I'm using whisper + open-webui
  - found an open-webui android app, but I think I have to build and sideload the apk myself [repo](https://github.com/cogwheel0/conduit)
  - found self-hosted Google analytics that I'd like to try on [[quadtask]] [here](https://github.com/pypeaday/rybbit)
  - forked [moocup](https://github.com/pypeaday/moocup) for screenshot pre-processing as a step between snipping the screen and uploading to [[shotput]]

## I'm not the only one

Looks like [komodo](https://github.com/pypeaday/komodo) is much of what I've envisioned for my "platform as a product"
