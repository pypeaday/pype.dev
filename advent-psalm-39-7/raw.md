!!! note "Psalm 39:7"

    And now, O Lord, for what do I wait?  My hope is for you.

Every Advent I wish I took it more seriously - each year trying to be slightly
more diligent about traditions and raising our daughters to understand more
than the material-driven "holiday season".

This year has had some ups and downs, ultimately God has been faithful to me in
amazing ways. And if he hadn't blessed me in the ways he has, he'd still be
faithful.

My hope is for Yahweh to save
