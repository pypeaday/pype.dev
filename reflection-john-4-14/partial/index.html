            <p>Today Spurgeon's &quot;Morning and Evening&quot; was on John 4:14</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">John 4:14</p>
<p>But whoever drinks of this water which I will give to him will never be thirsty for eternity, but the water which I will give to him will become in him a well of water springing up to eternal life.”</p>

<p>Being autistic and growing up in the Church led to a few acute pain points for
me growing up. A commonplace issue for me was when theological truths were
expressed in absolute terms but didn't &quot;feel absolutely true&quot; for me. I made a
practice of trying to force myself to just &quot;be ok&quot; in light of the truth.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">A Memory</p>
<p>Marissa was one of my best friends in high school - we spent a lot of time together in church, school, extra-curriculars, etc. She was an ever-present friend to me even when I was difficult to love. I recall multiple times, and one vivid memory for sure where I wasn't doing well and she inquired. But my response was &quot;I have Jesus, so I have to be OK&quot;. I tried to filter my immediate acute pain through the lens of eternal glory. And yes, Paul muses in this fashion as well, but Paul wasn't a 16 year old undiagnosed autistic... Was everythign going to be alright in the end when I was 16? Oh ya, but was everything all right then? No... Marissa was a great friend, and Jesus has been sweet to me in this struggle, but nonetheless it would've been awesome if someone recognized the pain I was in with the wisdom to address me back then.</p>
</div>
<p>Today, one of those truths comes up but it is not painful - <strong>it is so relieving</strong></p>

<p>Yesterday God brought me a truth that he sustains me unto his own service -
<a class="wikilink" href="/reflection-1-kings-19-8">reflection-1-kings-19-8</a>. And today I'm reminded that on his sustenance I
will &quot;never thirst&quot;. But of course this isn't a plain and simple truth. I
thirst for grace more and more every day, but what I'm finding in the season of
ending Summer 2025, post/present-multiple years of political awareness, and
near-hatred for my financial reliance on some other guy's company that my heart
<strong>wants</strong> for much right now, but even <strong>in that wanting</strong> this truth rests
softly on me that Jesus is and ought to be enough. I can be resistant to this
out of fear of losing a drive to provide more and more for my family.
Contentedness is certainly a gift from God, but as I've been reflecting I see
fear in my heart... As I've rejected the truth that &quot;Jesus is <strong>enough</strong>&quot; my
heart longs for satisfaction, and when I get in my own way then fear and sin
creep in.</p>
<p>For me and my reflection right now the competing ideas are building financial
wealth for myself and my family out of a desire for freedom from a system that
I don't like, but also... isn't Jesus enough? My heart is in the same cunundrum
as I was in at 16 when asked &quot;are you OK?&quot;. But with wisdom, experince, and
perspective I guess the tension isn't uncomfortable anymore (not that I'm
living in the tension perfectly). There's work for Jesus to do on my heart, and
yet I know the work he has done and that proves his faithfulness to me to not
leave me unfinished.</p>
<p>As he works on me, I have day-to-day choices to make.</p>
<ol>
<li>Whom will I serve?</li>
<li>What will fill my heart?</li>
<li>Will what I fill it with satisfy or like a glass of salt-water at sea leave me worse-off in the end?</li>
</ol>
<p>Jesus has been good to me in ushering my heart through truths like this where
there's an &quot;already but not yet&quot; element to them. Jesus fully satisfies my
heart, this is true. It's also true that I'm still a sinner. I don't feel like
I always only thirst for more of my Lord - today I thirst for a larger
retirement account and assets to financially support me for the next 20
years... is this wrong? I don't think so, not with appropriate perspective. And
I've been feeling more and more in the last few weeks that Jesus is restoring
me unto a new season of service and work. I don't know what it'll look like and
accepting a murky future feels scary, but in the light of the Son - by whose
grace my lungs fill with air as I type - I can walk and work with plans that
change knowing my faithful God satisfies.</p>
