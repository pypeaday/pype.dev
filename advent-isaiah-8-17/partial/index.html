<p class="admonition-title">Isaiah 8:17</p>
<p>And I will wait for Yahweh,  who hides his face from the house of Jacob,  and I will await him.</p>
</div>
<p><code>I will await him</code> -&gt; this isn't &quot;waiting&quot; like being patient... The first
&quot;wait&quot; is, but the second &quot;wait&quot; isn't the same word. Seems like a few English
translations are pick something along the lines of patience rather than
expectation here...</p>
<p>I'm not an expert, but I do think <code>hope</code> is a better translation - part of that
influence is that it's the first day's reflection from this BP Advent Calendar
and this first week of Advent is about &quot;Hope&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Hoping&quot; isn't just being patient - it's <strong>expecting</strong> what you are being
patient, it's longing for that thing to come, it's excited anticipation.</p>
<p>I'm in a short season of stress and waiting - but waiting for things that I
don't really want to happen, to happen... I pray in the Advent season Jesus will
keep my thoughts and hopes on him and not on the circumstances that are just as
imminent as His coming, albeit probably sooner.</p>
