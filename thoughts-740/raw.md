Here's my thought on <a href="https://restic.net/">ðŸ’­ restic Â· Backups done right!</a>

---

Welp, I need to be backing up my desktop home directory, specifically a directory of docker volume data... I thought duplicati made sense, but that mostly targets cloud-based backends, and rsync is great but I wasn't sure how i wanted to manage the job. 
Through a little AI chat I learned about restic and am working on a compose stack to run restic in a container to regularly backup my home directory via sftp to my NAS to then be swept up in my NAS backup workflow
