## Notes

- working on protecting blog posts with a password somehow too
  - pretty cool that I can pull in RSS but it pulls in the whole feed and then it's not super easy to edit everything... maybe worth it for one time additions - or could keep using FreshRSS for that and karakeep for other stuff.... though not notes, that's my blog... so it's kind of like archivebox, replaces texting myself messages with links and notes... that's probably where it fits.

## Men's Group

- Met at Chefo's today, talked about identity in Christ, what it means to abide, and why we still sin even though 1 John says "anyone who sins is not in him"
- I am leading on the next one - August 16. Note in [karakeep](https://karakeep.paynepride.com/dashboard/preview/opl94af4bwsdk55bg8xtd43h)

## Affine

What I am seeing about Affine is that the power is in the edgeless view. There's plenty of notion-esq apps for writting documents that have some special formatting. But the edgeless view allows you to represent more complicated relationships that are present in the document that are impossible to represent linearlly...

## Karakeep

- started setting up [karakeep](https://docs.karakeep.app/) today using [this blog](https://blog.mariofragnito.it/en-gb/posts/rss-and-read-later-with-miniflux/)

I can add stuff to karakeep, put it in a list, then expose the list as RSS and get the things that I want to read later in the feed reader, while still having karakeep now as a dumping grounds... now it feels actually like it does what thoughts does for me _almost_ ... there's an app and extension to play around with

- the firefox extension rocks...

- I wonder how the app is...

!!! success "It ephing rocks..."

    Why did I wait so long on this???
