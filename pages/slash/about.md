# Me

I'm a tech nerd who's been homelabbing since 2019 - I got started with pi-hole
and it's been all downhill ever since... see [[the-homelab]] for more info. I
write about things in the tech world as I've been thrust into it via hobbies
and work, and I also write about things related to theology and Christianity.
Jesus changes my life everyday and I try to write about some of that for my own
processing and perhaps my thoughts will be encouraging to someone who stumbles
across them

## Work

I work primarily as a platform engineer supporting data scientists and app
developers deploy their code on kubernetes based systems

## Hobbies

???+ note "Homelabbing"

    - [[the-homelab]]
    - [[homelab-journey-part-1]]

???+ note "BJJ"

    I got my blue belt in BJJ July 2023 (should blog about my BJJ experience...)

## Family

I have one.
