Started on [[2025-07-16-notes]] using this page for my "don't lose sight of the projects you're touching"

## Hot

- wrapping up [[gotify-cli-for-notifying-me-of-nextcloud-uploads]]

- [[thoughts-to-nostr]]
- [[deuteronomy-6-and-the-shema]]
- Migrating my homelab stuff to a mono repo

### Affine

The mind-mapping capabilities with Affine seem pretty great. There's a few
quirks I'm trying to become aware of, like the edgeless and page modes show you
the same info, but there isn't one view that makes _all_ the settings clear...
so for example just adding another block on a page doesn't make a new little
section in edgeless view - it just adds text to the existing blob. But in the
edgeless view I can click `+` off the side of a box and get a new distinct
bubble that I can type in and such, but then back in teh pages view it just
looks like I added a block. so the block view on the page doesn't represent the
other possible relationships whichi s fine, just need to be aware of it

- I have another JFlo vid now... falling behind

## Warm

- [Digital Harbor](https://mydigitalharbor.com) is my long standing "thing"... I'm not sure what it'll turn into

## Cold

Haven't forgotten about [[cronicle]]

or Soonish - event calendar and dashboard

Working on [[quadtask]]

I built a fun self-hosted weather app [[dad-can-i-wear-this]]
