Started on [[2025-07-16-notes]] using this page for my "don't lose sight of the projects you're touching"

## Writing

- [[consider-the-point]]
- [[self-hosting-a-code-forge-with-forgejo]]

- I want to start writing about some parenting concepts

  - discipline vs consequences vs punishment is one concept
    - [[consequences-discipline-and-punishment]]
  - love and the "greater will" for your child
    - goes hand-in-hand with something like "it's good for your child to suffer"

## Hot

- [[notifiq]]
- [[soonish]]
- [[mindful]]
- [[quadtask]]
- [[qr-harbor]]
- [[cannalyze]]

  - josh's site redirects still, it isn't his url so I still need to fix that

## BUGS

## Runescape

- [x] [Monkey Madness 1](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Monkey_Madness_I)
