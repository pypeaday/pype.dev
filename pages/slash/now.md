### Affine

The mind-mapping capabilities with Affine seem pretty great. There's a few
quirks I'm trying to become aware of, like the edgeless and page modes show you
the same info, but there isn't one view that makes _all_ the settings clear...
so for example just adding another block on a page doesn't make a new little
section in edgeless view - it just adds text to the existing blob. But in the
edgeless view I can click `+` off the side of a box and get a new distinct
bubble that I can type in and such, but then back in teh pages view it just
looks like I added a block. so the block view on the page doesn't represent the
other possible relationships whichi s fine, just need to be aware of it

- I have another JFlo vid now... falling behind
