How do I use AI for my site?

1. Cover images - I generate these with Stable Diffusion running on my desktop, the prompts sometimes comes from basically dropping my blog post into Ollama/Open-WebUI and getting a prompt back to make an image that fits the vibe
2. Breaking up raw blog posts by heading - AI never writes my posts for me, but sometimes with longer ramblings I will have an agent just break up by new lines with headings to help me group the thoughts together
3. Site asthetic - my site is built with [markata](https://markata.dev) but the templates (jinja, html, css) I have given almost fully over to AI because web-design isn't something I'm deeply interested in, but I like to write and the agents have helped me make my blog look more personal (I recognize some people might take offense to this - we can happily fight about it over a drink sometime :p)

My main thing to say is that I don't ever intend to put AI words in front of another human without full transparency like in [[the-importance-of-nostr-according-to-chatgpt]], but I am using AI to craft my blog and help me organize myself
