I bought a $20 PS4 knock-off controller recently as my PS4 controllers are 12
years old (to me!) and I bought them used before that... the instructions for a
$20 controller are obviously bad but a godsend redittor discovered the hidden
secret to pair this device with my computer! Instructions (for ps4) say to plug
it in, hit the home button, and you're paired. Now, that didn't work on PC
obviously, but it ALSO didn't work on my PS4... Unfortunte! It works wired just
fine, but turns out the magic to send the thing into traditional Bluetooth
Pairing Mode is to hold the home and share buttons down - wait for a rapid few
blinks - then you'll see the controller in your bluetooth pairing menu!
