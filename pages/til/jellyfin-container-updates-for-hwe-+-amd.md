I use LSIO Jelyfin container for the easy addon they provide for AMD GPUs but I couldn't get trickplay to work with HWE... 

There was almost NOTHING on the internet about the error, and all the threads were about BSD systems...

Thankfully someone posted [on the formum here](https://forum.jellyfin.org/t-jellyfin-amd-docker) but the only answer was to literally upgrade stuff in the container...

Someday maybe I'll build off of LSIO to add this, but until then I shell'd in and homelab'd the hell out of it

> THIS IS INSIDE THE CONTAINER - I use Portianer to make it easy
