!!! note "1 John 4:17"

    By this love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, because just as that one is, so also are we in this world.

## Confidence

I've definitely written about confidence before outside this blog, it's a key
Christian theme. John mentions here in the middle of a bunch of stuff about
love as he is wrapping up this letter.

Love is beautiful, and over this Advent season I've reflected a lot on verse 19
"We love, because he first loved us". Because of God, his original love for you
and me, his own power and majesty, his own right to rule and reign - because of
all of that I am to "have confidence in the day of judgement". Christmas isn't
so much about looking forward to a future time, it's remembering that the time
we look forward to is already here in part. Jesus has already come, once. He
brought heaven to earth and undid much of the curse of separation placed on
humans at Eden. It's because he's already done it, because he loved me first,
that confidence can follow. No Christian should find themselves concerned about
their position in front of the Lord any more than my daughter should ever be
concerned about her status as my daughter. There's nothing she could do to
separate herself from my love for her, and there is nothing I can do to
separate myself from God's love. In the binding of that love, is confidence for
security in the future. Not that all my bills are paid and I have a happy life

- but that in the ultimate sense, my purpose as an image-bearing Human will be
  fully realized, God's plan fully carried out, in the end. And I don't have to
  worry, because in his love I am secure, just like I hope that in my love my
  daughters are secure.

Christians struggle with doubt, and that's not a sin. John would encourage you
to take hold of being God's child, live that way, and in living like his child,
his love is revealed, and as it is revealed and perfected, confidence naturally
follows.

We aren't guaranteed much about life, but I have zero valid reasons to doubt
the King who saved me and will continue to save me. May Jesus' name be great,
he is King, amen.
