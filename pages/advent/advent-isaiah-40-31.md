!!! note "Isaiah 40:31"

    But those who wait for Yahweh shall renew their strength.  They shall go up with wings like eagles;  they shall run and not grow weary;  they shall walk and not be faint.

There is a pretty significant _thing_ going on in my life right now that's
causing me to grow a bit weary and faint. Essentially there are things and
people totally outside my control who have some non-trivial power over my life
in regards to work and it's weighing on me. It's been several months, and I
know God provides, and in fact already has... So as far as any _needs_ go, God
has fully taken care of me. Nonetheless, the injustices and power dynamics at
play in certain environments, like Corporate America, are still a reality that
I hardly have a word strong-enough to describe my distaste for...

But I'm still breathing, still coding, walking, writing, dad'ing, husband'ing,
etc... Faint and weary from the weight of these external factors, that
ultimately God is sovereign over, daily life still continues...

I saw our Advent wreath on the dining room table this morning, the first candle
still lit (we do battery candles for this, there was no open flame overnight)
and I was thankful to see it because it served its purpose first thing in the
morning - turn my eyes to Jesus and the expectant hope in his coming and
return... And in that hope, in that waiting, Yahweh renews my strength each day
to do the daily things, weather the external forces, and walk with my savior
today and every day

Praise the Lord for renewal and direction and may God have grace on me to
remind and renew me every day
