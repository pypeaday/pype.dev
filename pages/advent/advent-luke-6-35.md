!!! note "Luke 6:35"

    But love your enemies, and do good, and lend expecting back nothing, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.

## Love Your Enemies

I was once an enemy of God, and even today still make choices that highlight
enmity in my heart towards him. It's what's left-over, what will continue to
persist (though I hope be minimized as much as possible) while waiting for
Heaven to come to earth. Knowing and recognizing my own position - as a former
enemy, makes it somewhat easy to read these words to "do good" and "expect nothing
in return" from my enemies because God was good to me, and continues to be. So,
I am the ungrateful and the wicked that he is kind to.

How do I feel about that? Honestly, grateful but also a little ashamed. I
**know** who I am, and sometimes I choose to be who I was before. But God still
loves me and my heart is glad to be in his favor.
