!!! note "Zechariah 9:9-10"

    9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion!  Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem!  Look! Your king comes to you;  he is righteous and victorious,  humble and riding on a donkey,  and on a male donkey, the foal of a female donkey!  10 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim,  and the horse from Jerusalem;  the battle bow will be cut down,  and he will announce peace to the nations.  His dominion will be from sea to sea,  and from the River to the ends of the earth.

My king is indeed coming, and has already come. He is humble and he is
victorious. Jesus can "announce peace" because the Kingdom is his - over which to
announce whatever he wills. The rulers of this world fight for peace - they
make announcements that reality is under no obligation to adhere to. "Peace
through strength" is not a bad mentality from one nation to another, but within
the nation the citizens are ruled by one king whose word either has weight or
not. Often the weight of the word of the king is in the form of brutal
enforcement of the king's will. In the case of King Jesus though, there is
nothing brutal. He doesn't own the world by conquest, he owns it by right.
Reality itself _is under an obligation to obey the architect of the universe_.
So when King Jesus announces peace... what else can happen besides the word of
the Lord?
