## Desktop

Plasma updated after a reboot, and I'm not gonna try to rollback but it's a little messed up so I need to figure out:
1. my activity bar virtual desktops don't show what's on each desktop
2. the task bar doesn't show all windows (I remember fixing this before)
3. maybe use this as a time to make kde more like mac just for consistency with work

Fixed my long-standing broken keybinding for screenshot on desktop! and it's a dumb keybind but it matches what I use on mac...
