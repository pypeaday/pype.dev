## Today

- Liz asked me to write a book review for her a couple months ago and I finally got around to it...
- [[book-review-dula-fig-and-the-wisdom-of-old-sycamore]]

## Soonish

- I've been continuing to think about this but it's becoming more day-dreamy... I need to get something minimal deployed and start using it myself

## Wins

- Where have my wins gone?
- Tonight I didn't even try to be ultra productive, I just did all the dishes (which took a super long 15 minutes) and folded some clothes... It's kind of crazy what a very boring 30 minutes of work at home can do to set up your next day (or several in the case of laundry)
