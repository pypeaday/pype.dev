## Updates

- started my [[awesome]] list
- I missed something with speakr - need the HF_TOKEN for diarisation to work
  - [[speakr-for-recording-and-transcribing-at-home]]
  - with diarisation working I can continue my [[write-in-to-the-hybrid-cloud-show]]

## Reflection

- Didn't get into a good Bible focus time in the morning, definitely affected the day
- Vibe Coding... ugh, tempting and treacherous. The API I rolled out for work
was hard to think about, and using LLMs to build it got something up and going
but without me providing more subject matter expertise (due to the fact of not having any)
it's already heavier tech debt than I care to admit. Maybe I'm sour today and
defeated at the end of the day
- It's been weeks since my 100 push-ups - did them this evening
