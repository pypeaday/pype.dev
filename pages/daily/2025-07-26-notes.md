## Dev

- I kept working on my ansible playbook and just recipes for setting up a new machine... I just need to diagram it out to continue honing in the experience:

1. initial install of OS
2. python -m http.server from my desktop, download 
  - ssh key
  - skm backup? (haven't done this yet but feels potentially nice...)
3. clone ansible-playbooks
4. run bootstrap
  - bootstrap dotfiles?
  - just bootstrap?
  - do this with bash assuming just isn't installed yet
5. just <whatever set of things>

I'm not sure what's missing from my playbook still
