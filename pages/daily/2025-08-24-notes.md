yesterday: [[ 2025-08-23-notes ]]

## Github

- going to spin up speakr
  - Yes... it's replacing Whisper-WebUI
  - [[speakr-for-recording-and-transcribing-at-home]]

## Homelab

- I am slowly moving things to a mono-repo and that's going well
- Moved `ollama` and `open-webui` to a `ai` compose stack at home along with `speakr` and a whisper asr service
