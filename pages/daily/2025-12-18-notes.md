yesterday: [[2025-12-15-notes]]

- trying opencode today to generate a Linux MCP server so I can get some simple LLM-driven insights into a few things on my servers

## WINS

Today was huge for personal stuff, opencode is a beast even in the free `Big Pickle` + `Zen` offering. Windsurf with Opus-4-5 is doing well also

- Revamped the theme of [pype.dev](https://pype.dev)
- Rebuilt [Digital Harbor](https://mydigitalharbor.com)
  - including link pages
- Cleaned up and modularized a ton of terraform for my domains:
  - paynepride.com
  - pype.dev
  - 1man1.band and 1man1band.com
  - notifiq.net

## For Tomorrow

- josh's page needs his picture fixed
- josh's domains are broken... need to figure out a cloudflare solution or else a duplicate build
- notifiq docs and user onboarding should be focus - try gpt 5.2
