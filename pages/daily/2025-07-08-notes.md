Today I consolidated homelab-social-media-pipelines into homelab-temporal,
which is the app repo.

I am tracking this stuff in a [kanboard
ticket](https://kanboard.paynepride.com/?controller=TaskViewController&action=show&task_id=235&project_id=8)
and also [[thoughts-to-nostr]]

I also touched on my [[homelab-monitoring-agent]] bys witching to atomic-agents, but windsurf is struggling with it

Worked on backup of my desktop - in dotfiles I have nas-back which will be a
compose stack I can move to homelab-compose that uses restic to backup files
via stp/ssh - seems easy enough to setup
[[using-restic-to-backup-my-home-directory]]

I learned some stuff about python from chat - <https://chatgpt.com/c/686d2a05-5b54-800f-8b84-1638c1b96840>
