## RepoFlow

- requested free license for [repoflow](https://docs.repoflow.io/Self-Hosting/licensing) which I might be able to use for my platform artifact storage at home
- Got it spun up, been talking with Tomer, the guy who sent me the license.
- repoflow is like an artifactory replacement - artifact storage... overkill for my homelab, but interesting. And might be a component I package up with $HOME... need to have a good name for that thing still

## Things

-  Will plan to finish  [[olivet-mens-group-august-2025]] this week for next saturday
- would like to write mote about [[when-i-learned-what-an-esacape-room-was]]
- need temp graph on [[dad-can-i-wear-this]] but man windsurf has sucked at adding this the last few times I've tried and I ain't no web dev!

Been hard to be motivated to push through on almost anything lately... trying at least to just not lose sight of things I want to do and to do small things as I can...

## Wins

- stood up repoflow for first time
