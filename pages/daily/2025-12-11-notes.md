yesterday: [[2025-12-09-notes]]

- Linux Matters mentioned some song visualizers and one of the hosts even wrote
  one... I've recently been lamenting that I'm not very good at doing something
  "just for me", I always need an angle and this is a pretty annoying mental
  battle that I'm in the middle of practically all the time. But I loved
  visualizers as a kid, Windows Media Player + Limewire was a match made in
  heaven. So, I'm gonna toss [this visualizer]() onto a screen today with my
  tunes

- Messed around with Cloudflare Tunnels today finally. Sweet little piece of
  tech. I'm going to use it for hosting notifiq. I got my tunnel setup with
  terraform which is awesome - I will bring that into my homelab infrastructure
  module and clean it all up since I took a look tonight after several months and
  oh boy have I learned a thing or 2 about terraform in that time...
