## Reflection on AI

- [[reflection-ai-work-and-adhd]]


## TODOs

I need to think about how to keep track of daily tasks across my different work streams...
  - self hosted time tracker
  - affine or something
  - stream-specific tool
    - working-notes blog with `now` page?

## Wins

- Q: how did today go with time-boxing per [[reflection-ai-work-and-adhd]]? 
  - I would say ok... an office hours went from 1 hours to 3 hours
  unfortunately, and that definitely affected afternoon momentum. However, I
  attempted to set a timer for a few tasks with the clock on my wall, and
  helped to stay focused. 

## Runescape

- Totally going to become a member again after finishing the last few free-to-play quests
- [[runescape-os-mobile-experience]]
- updated [[starting-old-school-runescape-over-again]]
