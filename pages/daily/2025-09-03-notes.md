## Reflection

- it's been a few days... pick the torch up again tomorrow with morning and evening

## TOODs

- update the Sch. (friends) loan to pause to Dec.

## Runescape

- Did many things today - working on slayer stuff. Mazchna is the Slayer Master I should talk to, but I have to do `priest in peril` first, which I'll finish tonight
- Doing [The Fremennik Trials](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/The_Fremennik_Trials) quest now, it's a bit longer but I need that sweet [Farseer Helm](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Farseer_helm) for the ranged/magic bonus!
