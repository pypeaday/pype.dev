yesterday: [[2025-07-12-notes]]

## Affine

- More with affine and mind-mapping (I bookmarked a TT BJJ video I wanted to make a map of from JFlo)

## Writing

- Write up more on restic - how to check backups etc. (and do it while you write it up... duh)
- Andrew's sermon today had several good points I want to meditate on.
  - biblical friendship
  - deut 6, shema
    1. I talk about obedience a lot, but I should to it with more focus on grace and love, not so much _during_ the girls being disobedient
    2. I need to use the word shema with the girls - help adorn them with the fear of the Lord. deut 6 and proverbs 1
    - [[deuteronomy-6-and-the-shema]]

## Projects to touch

- [[thoughts-to-nostr]]
- [[daily-notes-neovim-plugin]]

## Wins

- lots of outside time with the girls today
