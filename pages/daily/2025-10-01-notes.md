## Reflection

- [[reflection-psalm-84-11]]

## Projects

- A friend hit me up for some help with git because he's building a game with someone
  - It was interesting to see how Unreal Engine 5 claimed to have git support, but it's really just a single branch local repo
  - ChatGPT also led my buddy so astray it was hilarious.... good sobering reminder that AI will lead you astray if you don't know what you're researching, myself included
