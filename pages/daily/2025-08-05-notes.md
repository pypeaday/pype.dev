## Today

- wrote [[setup-remote-minio-s3-backend-target-for-litestream]]
- working on litestream with quadtask, bigger plans eventually for backing up all my apps dbs to minio, probably self-hosting everything and getting off fly eventually... not sure
- started [[using-litestream-to-backup-quadtasks-sqlite-db]]

## Fly.io

- pain point: cert management
- no terraform, fly cli... this is probably fine
