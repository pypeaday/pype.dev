yesterday: [[ 2025-08-12-notes ]]


## Pilgrim's Creek

- fish story about studying the same fish every day to become a good biologist
- discussed many things, didn't actually record today
- 4 hour chat... oof lol

## Forjeo

- spun it up (again?)
- what I have up can't stay up - I had to `chown 777` the docker volume and idk why... will debug later, for now just playing around
  - migrate function for my blog was easy
  - need to learn a thing or 2 about forjeo actions now
    - looks like I'll add a runner service, and a docker-in-docker service as a way for the runner to do docker stuff I guess... why don't we just give the runner the docker socket?
