yesterday: [[2025-07-13-notes]]

Yesterday I basically got 0 things done computer-wise. So this is mostly a copy paste of my morning notes from yesterday:

## Affine

- More with affine and mind-mapping (I bookmarked a TT BJJ video I wanted to make a map of from JFlo)

## Writing

- Write up more on restic - how to check backups etc. (and do it while you write it up... duh)
- Andrew's sermon today had several good points I want to meditate on.
  - biblical friendship
- Notes on obedience with kids and my patterns for instruction
  1. I talk about obedience a lot, but I should to it with more focus on grace and love, not so much _during_ the girls being disobedient
  2. I need to use the word shema with the girls - help adorn them with the fear of the Lord. deut 6 and proverbs 1
  - [[deuteronomy-6-and-the-shema]]
- [[python-editable-installs-and-nested-scripts]]

## Projects to touch

- [[thoughts-to-nostr]]
- [[daily-notes-neovim-plugin]]
- no notes but I'm continuing to iterate on my dotfiles and pype.dev theming
  with windsurf - mostly just to keep a portion of my brain occupied with
  lightweight project management
