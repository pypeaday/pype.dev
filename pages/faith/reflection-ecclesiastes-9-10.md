!!! note "Ecclesiastes 9:10"

    Whatever your hand finds to do—do it with all your might; for in Sheol—where you are going—no one works, plans, knows, or thinks about anything.

!!! warning "Reflection vs Hermeneutics"

    I put this little disclaimer on posts where I'm sure the direction of my
    reflection isn't necessarily consistent with a exegetical teachin gon the
    passage I'm reflecting on. I do not know the intimate context of Ecclesiastes 9
    and so this reflection in very inra-personal and is not meant to be a point in
    teaching in any capacity

## Finding

**Whatever your hand finds to do**... The beginning assumes a search. The faithful
Christian is not idle... he seeks to do good because it's God's calling on the
human life to steward creation well which requires _work_.

**Finding** doesn't only presume a search, it indicates finding things on the
search... There is no shortage of godly things to do because every single day
we're faced with choices that either align or don't with the will Yahweh.

So whatever my hand does in fact _find to do_ I am _to do_ with _might_...

Lately I have not done what I find to do with all my might. I think God is so
good to me, and has blessed me through years of transformation to align more
and more of my will with his... but I've been meaning to refactor something at
work for 7 months that's actually keeping me up at night, I pick up my phone to
scroll when I have a ticket to work on or worse - when I could be watching my
kids play. I very clearly **do not do with all my might whatever my hand finds
to do**

## Grace

And yet God continues to be good to me. He continues to teach me and correct
me, and in this reflection I feel the same consistent & persistent nudge I've
been feeling since the end of Summer. Praise God for this nudge - to keep going
in his grace and seek to make better choices today than yesterday.

By God's grace, the things I do with my might/strength, he often blesses. And I have
full confidence in my King that I will be able to work, plan, know, and think a
lot both in this unconsecrated heavenly age as well as in the eschaton. Sheol
still holds some power over me, I have been freed by my King but he hasn't yet
come back. In the **already but not yet** the Christian is still to seek the
Lord and trust him.

He's been faithful to me - [[ebenezer]].
