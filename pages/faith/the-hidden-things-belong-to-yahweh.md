!!! note "Deuteronomy 29:29"

    The hidden things belong to Yahweh our God, but the revealed things belong to us to know and to our children forever, in order to do all the words of this law.

Here is a truth every Christian should meditate on and remember whenever they
find themselves so sure of a biblical teaching. There are things not meant for
us to know - not that we cannot enjoy the musings, but we need to rightly
understand that there are mechanisms in the world that are only known to
Yahweh. Just like my daughters have no actual understanding of how they became
my daughters, or how money shows up in our account every month, or how water
comes to our house... These things are beyond their scope of existence to be
honest, and there are analogous things that we fully-grown mature adults need
to recognize are beyond us and are for the Lord, only.

This is not an excuse or encouragement though to never be sure of a
conviction... there most certainly are "revealed things \[that\] belong to us
to know". So the Christian needs to graciously approach the things we can't run
away from, but also recognize that our understanding is, by nature of our
existence, limited.

The truth a lot of us wrestle with, and probably not very well, is
**Soteriology** - the theology of salvation. There are a number of things that
go into the mechanism of receiving salvation from the Lord: a regenerated
heart, faith in Jesus alone, confession, and the process of becomming more like
Jesus (sanctification). However, the **order by which** these things happen has
been a long-debated issue in the Church and has led to a lot of
Christian-division.

I'm not going to claim to understnad the [orto salutis] but what I can do is
recognize a reality in my life, perhaps even somewhat contradictory realties,
and given that objective truth of those realities I'll have to eventually
recognize that the intimate understanding and knowledge of the inner-workings
of those realities is hidden from me.

It goes like this - no one can choose Yahweh on their own. We are born into death and decay:

!!! note "Ephesians 2:1"

    And you, although you were dead in your trespasses and sins,

!!! note "Romans 3:23"

    for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,

So inconvenient truth number 1: you are dead, dead people can't make choices or
do anything... but surely "dead in your tresspasses" and "fall short of the
glory of God" are just indicators that we can't live a perfectly "good" life...
no?

Well, it won't really matter and here's why:

!!! note "John 14:6"

    Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

So here's the thing - either Jesus is the son of God or he isn't... Simple
binary truth. If he's **not** the son of God, then half of this blog is
worthless and Paul's words that Christians should lbe pitied above all people
would never be more true... But if Jesus **is the son of God** and his words
**are actual truth** then you really need to wrestle with it, if only for a
second... He's either a crazy liar, or literally God. This truth, or the option
of which of these things are true, are 100% unavoidable for every person to
deal with. Like, you have to make a choice - either accept what Jesus says, or
don't.

But that actually brings up the tension - you can't accept it unless Yahweh
gives you over to Jesus.

!!! note "John 6:37–40"

    Everyone whom the Father gives to me will come to me, and the one who comes
    to me I will never throw out, 38 because I have come down from heaven not that
    I should do my will, but the will of the one who sent me. 39 Now this is the
    will of the one who sent me: that everyone whom he has given me, I would not
    lose any of them, but raise them up on the last day. 40 For this is the will of
    my Father, that everyone who looks at the Son and believes in him would have
    eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”

So... is the one born destined to not believe simply destined for hell? What
kind of loving God is that?

The answer there is actually pretty simple - he's a loving father. I wrote a
little bit about this via analogies to my own life as a parent in
[[advent-2025---love]]. Essentially as a dad, I take my own kids home from the
playground every day, not your kids. Likewise, God will redeem his own... It's
literally a perfectly reasonable expectation of a dad.

## Hidden vs. Revealed

What is for us and what is for God alone then (as we discuss Soteriology)? A
lot. And in this case I'm not even sure where to draw the line but here is a
simple list of truths that **are true** even though I couldn't explain with
every nuance - how?

1. I hated God - every unregenerate person does, it is **only natural** to hate
   what you're opposed to. Being born into sin and death necessarily means you
   are are opposed to life and godliness.
2. I now love God - my personal story here is a picture of God's providence -
   see [[helkyo-what-is-it-for-god-to-draw-man-to-him]]
3. Yahweh desires for all people to be reconciled (1 Peter)
4. Not everyone believes in Jesus - which means there are people destined for
   hell

Here's what I think is hidden...

1. The reasons which God chooses some and not others - thank the Lord this is
   not for me to know
2. The mechanism by which my heart is able to make a **free** choice, out of my
   own agency, not to initially believe in Jesus, but every day to lay my life
   down before him (as I do or do not live faithfully to him)
3. What reality of "hell" there is to be predestined to... I cannot deny at all
   that not all people are chosen by God, not all people will enter the
   Celestial City... But what of the others? I genuinely do not know, but I have a
   lot of confidence that the fire and torture crowd are missing some stuff.

## Fin

Praise the Lord that there are things beyond us to know... It is comforting to
know that Jesus loves me, and I don't need to know much more beyond that. Just
like one of my biggest desires is for my daughters to trust me because of my
love for them, in the same way is how I find and am comforted by the Lord. If
you're reading this and haven't heard him call your name, maybe sit and listen.
When Jesus called Lazarus from the grave, he might've had the choice whether to
walk out or not, but he didn't have the choice to not wake-up. If the Lord
awakens your heart today, may you make the choice to walk out of the grave and
into new life.
