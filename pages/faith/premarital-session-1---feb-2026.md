# Covenant, Calling, and Friendship

## Purpose

To establish a biblical vision of marriage that shapes expectations, priorities, and endurance.

## Key Scriptures

Genesis 2:18–25; Malachi 2:14; Ephesians 5:31–32; Proverbs 18:22

!!! note "Genesis 2:18-25"

    18 Then the Lord God said, “It is not good for the man to be alone. I will
    make a helper (עֵ֫זֶר |e-zer ) corresponding (נֶ֫גֶד | ne-ged) to him.” 19 The
    Lord God formed out of the ground every wild animal and every bird of the
    sky, and brought each to the man to see what he would call it. And whatever the
    man called a living creature, that was its name. 20 The man gave names to all
    the livestock, to the birds of the sky, and to every wild animal; but for the
    man no helper was found corresponding to him. 21 So the Lord God caused a deep
    sleep to come over the man, and he slept.
    God took one of his ribs and closed the flesh at that place. 22 Then the Lord
    God made the rib he had taken from the man into a woman and brought her to the
    man. 23 And the man said:  This one, at last, is bone of my bone  and flesh of
    my flesh;  this one will be called “woman,”  for she was taken from man.
    24 This is why a man leaves his father and mother and bonds with his wife, and
    they become one flesh. 25 Both the man and his wife were naked, yet felt no
    shame.

!!! success "helper corresponding"

    This is the helper opposite him - balance

!!! note "Malachi 2:14"

    And you ask, “Why?” Because even though the Lord has been a witness between
    you and the wife of your youth, you have acted treacherously against her. She
    was your marriage partner and your wife by covenant.

!!! warning "God as the witness"

    "the wife of your youth" Since a Jewish marriage was religious and involved a
    covenant, God served as the witness (Mal 2:10). Thus, a Jewish man abandoning
    his Jewish wife was tantamount to abandoning a vow to God Himself.

!!! note "Ephesians 5:31-32"

    31 For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be joined to
    his wife, and the two will become one flesh. 32 This mystery is profound, but I
    am talking about Christ and the church.

!!! note "Proverbs 18:22"

    A man who finds a wife finds a good thing  and obtains favor from the Lord.

## Themes

Marriage is covenantal, not consumerism sustained by feelings.

- Serving your spouse is serving the Lord, as long as you both seek to serve
  Jesus then you will naturally (since it's a natural consequence of serving the
  Lord) serve one another **with the right heart**. Your service is not to each
  other directly, it is to the Lord

God uses marriage as a primary means of sanctification.

- Parenting is hard because you are forced to put your needs on hold for the
  sake of your kids sometimes, but love makes it easier and kids are level 2.
  Level 1 is your spouse - as you put your needs on hold for your spouse Jesus
  changes your heart to help you really see that other person as equally as
  valuable as yourself. Not necessarily **more valuable**, that isn't the point,
  the point is that the ground is level at the foot of the cross, and daily
  consistent rendering of service to your spouse **as to the Lord** is a
  transformative experience in the direction of seeing others how Jesus does.

Friendship and unity go right along with roles, logistics, and preferences.

- Dedicate yourselves to the Lord and friendship will follow.

## Discussion Prompts

What do you believe makes a marriage “successful”?

- calm and charitable disagreement
- established and respected order
  - Devin will be the head
  - the head of the body should probably listen to the body quite intensely before making decisions...
- do people outside your marriage see Jesus as a crucial player in your
  relationship or is all about the 2 of you? Culture would have it look like 2
  puzzle pieces that fit together perfectly, but the reality is that a godly
  marriage should frame the gospel. When people look at your relationship, they
  shouldn't just see 2 best friends in love, they should somewhat immediately see
  and know about Jesus' role in your relationship

Where do you think cultural ideas about marriage fall short?

- literally everywhere

What promises feel most weighty to you as you think about your vows?

How do you currently cultivate friendship and closeness?

## Mentor Contribution

Share briefly how covenant faithfulness has shaped your own marriage.

Share how unity is built intentionally over time, not assumed.

## Reflection

What do you hope God will form in you through marriage?
