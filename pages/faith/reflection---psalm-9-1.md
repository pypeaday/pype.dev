!!! note "Psalm 9:1"

    I will thank Yahweh with all my heart. I will tell of all your wonderful deeds.

## Praise God

The phrase "praise God" has become a common phrase in my life. I'm blessed to
have my best friend, Michael, in my life after 15+ years. Back in high school,
I forget how it came up, but he told me that anytime something good happens, he
forces himself to just audibly say "praise God". Jesus certainly quickened that
to my heart, and it was again in high school that I witnessed some fruit of,
not using the phrase, but practicing giving glory to God in the smaller moments.

Some youth group kids were helping a church member replace their roof - so lots
of high-schoolers tearing shingles off, hauling garbage, etc. As we were on the
roof, one of the guys nearly fell off (we hadn't even heard of "tie-offs"
before). Something like a nail caught his shorts and he recovered his grip. I
immediately said "Praise God", and him and another guy looked at me and they go
".... ya! Praise God for sure!" and I think they had a similar experience then
like I had with Michael, where when something good happens we draw attention to
the Lord, and that edifies those around us.

I don't know when it became habit, but certainly "today" not a day goes by where
the phrase "Praise God" doesn't leave my lips at least once. On one hand, I
think Jesus has changed my heart to be more immediately responsive to him as
the giver of good things, and so it's natural now that when something good
happens not to "just say" "Praise the Lord", but to give thanks and actually
praise the Lord!. This has been an edifying practice in my life for my own
heart. However, on the other hand, bringing attention to God's glory in the
wake of good things is good for others. I have noticed my wife and kids, in
their own ways, adopt a similar response to good things, and that's
been a steady stream of encouragement for me as the Lord continues to shape me
and my family.
