The Shema from Judaism, archived in Deuteronomy 6, is a pinnacle tradition in
Hebrew Judaism, and _should be_ in Christianity. I cannot claim to be an
expert, but it's one of the fundamentals - shema means to listen AND obey, and
this was the primary charge given to God's people. His people were also to
repeat his commandments, make them apart of their lives, and introduce their
children to the Laws of God so that the next generation may not lose sight of
God's oracles and truths.

!!! note "The Shema"

    Deuteronomy 6:4–5 (LEB): 4 “Hear, Israel, Yahweh our God, Yahweh is unique. 5 And you shall love Yahweh your God with all of your heart and with all of your soul and with all of your might.

## My Kids

I talk with my kids about _obedience_ a lot... and it's fine, because they're
young kids in a stage of life of needing near-constant correction. I love them
and so because I love them they need to obey me, because no one in the world
cares more about their safety and flourishing than I do, and no matter what
_they see_ they need to trust me more than what they see - ie. listen to me
over anything else going on... Now, this is a hard lesson for a child certainly,
but is it not exactly what Jesus requests of me? How easy would I say it is then?

But I think the key with the kids is to regularly talk about listening in the
context of love and grace. We tell our girls constantly that we love them, that
they're safe and protected, and because of those truths they should listen to
us (the parents).

## The Point

This isn't a ground breaking post, to even grace it with the title... It's a
short reminder to me that kids need structure and guidance. I am here to
provide that to my kids. And in the exact same way that they are to `shema`, to
listen and obey me, I am to `shema`, to listen and obey the Lord... For the
Lord my God is One.
