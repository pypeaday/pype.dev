## The Beginning

[[the-wrath-to-come]] is only the beginning, because for the true son or
daughter of the King, the wrath directed at the enemy, at the threat, is a
**divine grace**. The general understanding I see people have is to take the
position that we're all God's kids, so any anger/wrath he exhibits against
anyone is somehow a contradiction to his loving nature.

His demonstration of wrath towards his enemies is a great proof of the love he
has for his children though. If everyone erroneously takes a view that we're all
God's children then there's not any room to talk about the enemies of God. YOU
are the enemy! As was I... and it's by God's divine love and sovereignty that I
have been adopted into his family. It's by nothing more than love and
sovereignty that **anyone** is adopted.

If you are a child of the King, then wrath is only the beginning,
because the rest of that story is of protection and love. Humanity gets hung up
on wrath thinking we're the good guys and God owes us one, but this isn't a
Biblical worldview.

When people talk about god, god's wrath, god's love, etc...
I like to ask "which god?" because a lot of people aren't talking about my
God, the True God-King, when they make claims about love and wrath... Most
people want a grandpa in the sky too senile to recognize when they've done
something wrong - but my King is the farthest thing from that caricature and his
grand love for his people will be shown in many ways. Watching his wrath from
behind the angelic armies will look much more like grace and love than hatred
and anger, but for the enemies of God facing him at the front I'm sure 'wrath'
will be all they see.

## Choices

Life is made up of choices, and I don't think making a choice based on fear is
ideal. I do not think that anyone can **will themselves**, by fear or
not, to "accept Jesus" - ie. saving faith in the Lord isn't something anyone
can arrive at on their own, it is a gift.

So the question is, when the gift is sat in front of you, the gift of adoption
and eternal life, divine and eternal grace, do you accept it? Or let it pass
by... Because that choice dictates a lot about how God looks at you. He's
either protecting you from his enemies, or you are his enemy. And to be honest,
when the enemies of God try to slander his name by calling him hateful and
referring to wrath as though it should change the reality of who he is - all I
see are enemies and propaganda. I know my God loves me, it's been proven over
and over.

Yahweh is not a senile old man in the sky, he is the conquering King and he
will protect his own. So thank God for love and wrath.
