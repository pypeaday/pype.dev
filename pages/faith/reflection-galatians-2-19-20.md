!!! note "Galatians 2:19-20"

    19 For through the law I died to the law, in order that I might live to
    God. I have been crucified with Christ, 20 and I no longer live, but Christ
    lives in me, and that life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son
    of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

This is one of the most common verse-memory verses I think. Probably there's
good reason for that - Paul has a lot to say to the Galatians, and these 2
verses summarize one of the simple truths of the Gospel - the life a Christian
is given is **freed from** the law of death and make alive to Jesus. The gospel
truth is that the law is no longer the thing we answer to - everyone will,
certainly. There's no mistake to be made that every human has accountability
for their own agency. In our "free" will, bound to sin and death and to the law
for approval, we aren't free at all but slaves to an oppressive overlord. Jesus
frees the Christian to live a life free from that oppression, in the
life-giving security of God's adoption.

## Who love me and gave himself for me

God adopts whoever he chooses. And the ones he chooses are then freely able to
choose him in return. Through the life-giving power of God's sovereignty my
life can be fundamentally altered, my make-up changed, my family line updated.
I am free to live my life by faith in Jesus, because he loved me and gave
himself for me.
