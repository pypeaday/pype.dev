## Passage

Romans 7:7–7:13 (ESV): 7 What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no
means! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I
would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, “You shall
not covet.” 8 But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced
in me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin lies dead. 9 I was
once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive
and I died. 10 The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to
me. 11 For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and
through it killed me. 12 So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and
righteous and good. 13 Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no
means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that
sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful
beyond measure. 

## Reflection

As I was dimwittedly working through 1 John 3 for
[[olivet-mens-group-august-2025]] I found myself gravitating towards Romans 7
and 8 as it brings clarity to John's words about practicing sin vs being a
child of God.

???+ note "Personal"

    God's been good to me as I have started trying to be more focused in
    theological study and reflection... It has been long enough for my "break" to
    be over

It goes without saying in Christian circles that Romans is a tough cookie...
Paul packs a lot in the letter and although I'm focusing right now on 7 verses,
the context certainly matters when it comes to deeper study. As for me this
morning I believe God's calling me to reverse-sear my conscience in regards to
some persistent sins in my life. I write a little note in my notes for the olivet study:

> As I write this out, the Christian concept of "setting the captives free" and
jubilee and freedom strike my heart deeply. Just these phrases begin to call up
emotions. But as I look at my life right now, what am I doing that shouts
freedom? I spend more time lately playing games than being entrenched in
theological study, I think about work more than things which are noble and
praiseworthy, and I seem to purposefully focus on my own situations internally
rather than on God's grace (which I do externally a lot - but I feel this
tension inside - __a hook of doubt__)

These aren't the motifs in the passage, but the conversation around sin in our
hearts spiderwebs throughout scripture very quickly if the conversation is to
be worth anything... Freedom is core in a Christian worldview, but am I free
and devoted to Jesus or a morally bankrupt slave to myself?

So far I haven't even touched the passage so let me dive in a bit.

???+ note ""

    The rest of this post was dictated and transcribed via a STT utility I have at home. I often do this and rework my thoughts but here it's easier to word vomit the ideas and hope they make sense on the other side. I loosely edited it for readability but for whatever it's worth, this is moreso my thinking voice than my public speaking voice

"What then shall we say, that the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law I would not have known sin."

And that feels to me a little bit like Paul saying what I've heard other Christians today say — something like:
"I didn't struggle with anger until I became a Christian and then it was a struggle!"

So there's that side of it.

And then the other side of it is that God has "written eternity on our hearts," has He not? And through Common Grace, do we not all understand very common morality?

Aside from our worldviews, there are things that we know are wrong. Murdering is simply wrong. Another good example is something like cowardice—or like Paul will go on to say, covetousness.

Whether you're a Christian or not, you wouldn't value covetousness or cowardice. Cultures across the world and across history reject these things.

So, through becoming a Christian, the struggle with sin really begins — because it's the understanding not that something is just kind of morally wrong, but that you're violating the law of the Creator of the universe.

Now, we don't want to dive in so deep that we reject the context (of Paul's thoughts in Romans 7:7–13). And so, I don't want to dissect these few verses too much.

And so what's my reflection?

I don't know.

Sin is crouching at the door.
And it deceives me.
So, through the law, I learn what my sin is—it lets me name my killer.

The law didn't bring death—it brings understanding of death, because it reveals sin, which produces death.

But the part that I'm not "to" in my heart yet is the end of the passage. Verse 13:

"Did that which is good then (the law) bring death to me? By no means! It was sin producing death in me through what is good (the law), in order that sin might be shown to be sin and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure."

And I think that that phrase "sinful beyond measure" is a reflection of Paul's understanding of sin in his life.

Now, I claim I have the same mental understanding...

Later on in Romans 7, Paul talks about his "inner man" and his mind being a slave to the law of the Spirit, but his body being a slave to sin.

But can I really say that my mind is a slave to the law of the Spirit?

I certainly would make a lot of theological points about it—but is it really?

That's my reflection this morning.

I'm not as convicted over sin in my life, and so this reverse conscience searing needs to happen.
