# James

2023 study of the book of James

## BP

### The Guy

Greek: Iakobos (Jacob in English)

Jacob is one of Jesus' half-brothers who became a leader of the Jerusalem church post-resurrection

The book of James is the legacy of this Jacob's wisdom which was heavily influenced by two things:

1. Sermon on the Mount / Matthew 5-7
2. Proverbs - expecially chapters 1-9

### Summary

These are short challenging wisdom speeches full of metaphors and one-liners... Live in a wise way, submitting to Jesus

Chapters 2-5 teach about wholehearted devotion to Jesus - there are 12 teachings total

Chapter 1 the introduction

2-4: life's trials produce endurance and can make us _perfect_ and _complete_

_perect_ is repeated 7 times in the book - it refers to "wholeness" and integrity.

We are all fractrued and inconsistent people

_perfect_: Hebrew: Tamim, Greek: Teleios

5-8: God gives wisdom to those who ask in faith

9-11: povety can force us tot rust on God alone; wealth will pass away

12-18: God is generous and gives us new birth through Jesus

19-27: Don't just listen to God's word but _do_ it. It's the Torah of Freedom

- speak with love
- serve the poor
- be wholly devoted to God

## Jan 21

!!! scripture "James 1:1"

    James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes in the Dispersion: Greetings.

Dispersion: διασπορά - same word used by Peter to describe Jesus-followers as exiles

!!! scripture "James 1:2-11"

    2 Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds,
    3 for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. 4 And
    let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and
    complete, lacking in nothing.  5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask
    God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given
    him. 6 But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts
    is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. 7 For that
    person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; 8 he
    is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.  9 Let the lowly brother
    boast in his exaltation, 10 and the rich in his humiliation, because like a
    flower of the grass he will pass away. 11 For the sun rises with its
    scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty
    perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.

> Missed several meetings due to unfortunate travel circumstances

!!! scripture "James 3:13-18"

    13 Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him
    show his works in the meekness of wisdom. 14 But if you have bitter jealousy
    and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.
    15 This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly,
    unspiritual, demonic. 16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there
    will be disorder and every vile practice. 17 But the wisdom from above is first
    pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits,
    impartial and sincere. 18 And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by
    those who make peace.

## December 16

!!! scripture "James 5:13-20"

    13 Is anyone among you suffering misfortune? He should pray. Is anyone
    cheerful? He should sing praise. 14 Is anyone among you sick? He should
    summon the elders of the church and they should pray over him, anointing
    him with olive oil in the name of the Lord. 15 And the prayer of faith will
    save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up, and if he has
    committed sins ⌊he will be forgiven⌋. 16 Therefore confess your sins to one
    another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The effective
    prayer of a righteous person accomplishes much. 17 Elijah was a human being
    with the same nature as us, and ⌊he prayed fervently⌋ for it not to rain,
    and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. 18 And he
    prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the earth produced its fruit.
    19 My brothers, if anyone among you should wander away from the truth and
    someone turns him back, 20 he should know that the one who turns a sinner
    back from the error of his way will save that person’s soul from death, and
    will cover over a great number of sins.

### When to pray

1. All circumstances of life
2. Sickness
3. Confession
4. Working out the will of God
5. Retrieving wandering souls

James ends his letter with prayer because it's an exhortation of the Disapora
and a life of faith must revolve around prayer

For myself I think I pray in all circumstances, sickness, confession all ok. I
do not pray for long periods of time, and don't feel very disiplined, but
whenever anything happens, by the Lord's grace I am quick to turn my
attention to Jesus, and hopefully turn the attention of my wife/kids to Jesus
as well. Example: a person collapsed at the water park we went to this last
weekend, Athalia and I were close-ish to that happening, so I told her we
needed to stop what we were doing and pray that Jesus would intervene.

I confess sin to Jesus but I'm not sure what that **should** look like. I've
taken a Brother Lawrence approach to try and quickly confess and move on,
accepting grace, but I struggle with intentional sinning in this area... What
is prayer if I knew what I was doing was wrong?

I am not more inclined to pray for suffering, but I think that's because I've
very consciously been trying to pray in good circumstances more often because
when we only pray in suffering that turns prayer into a Santa's wish list
situation I think... yes we need the Lord in suffering, but we display our need
for him NOT only in suffering, and if that is true then it begs the question,
to me anyways, of whether or not the need is truly there

### JC Ryle's quote

I disagree with the dude's quote about the requirement of prayer, but only
because the message is given in a direction that makes prayer look like
something I have to do to get/keep/maintain my salvation... Yahweh changes his
children's hearts and orients them towards him through prayer - if someone
doesn't then I think that just means Yahweh has not worked or has not chosen
them, but them calling themselves a Christian is irrelevant, and no amount of
forcing themselves to pray will change Yahweh's will.

!!! scripture "Isaiah 1:6"

    From the sole of the foot and up to the head
    there is no health in it;
    bruise and sore and bleeding wound have not been cleansed,
    and they have not been bound up
    and not softened with the oil.

!!! scripture "Psalm 23:5"

    5 You prepare before me a table
    in the presence of my oppressors.
    You anoint my head with oil;
    my cup is overflowing.

!!! scripture "1 Kings 17:1-16"

    17 Elijah the Tishbite from Tishbe of Gilead said to Ahab, “⌊As Yahweh
    lives⌋, the God of Israel before whom I stand, there shall surely not be
    dew nor rain these years ⌊except by my command⌋.” 2 Then the word of Yahweh
    came to him, saying, 3 “Go from this place and turn to the east; you must
    hide yourself in the Wadi Kerith ⌊which faces the Jordan⌋. 4 It shall be
    that you shall drink from the wadi, and I have commanded the crows to
    sustain you there.” 5 So he went and did according to the word of Yahweh.
    He went and stayed in the Wadi Kerith ⌊which faces the Jordan⌋. 6 The crows
    were bringing bread and meat in the morning for him and bread and meat in
    the evening, and he drank from the wadi. 7 It happened ⌊after a while⌋ that
    the wadi dried up, because there was no rain in the land.

    8 Then the
    word of Yahweh came to him, saying, 9 “Get up and go to Zarephath which
    belongs to Sidon and stay there. Look, I have commanded a woman there, a
    widow, to sustain you.” 10 So he arose and went to Zarephath and came to
    the gate of the city. There was a widow woman gathering wood, so he called
    to her, and he said, “Please bring a little water for me in a vessel so
    that I can drink.” 11 She went to fetch it, and he called to her and said,
    “Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.” 12 She said, “⌊As Yahweh
    your God lives⌋, surely I do not have a cake, ⌊but only a handful of flour⌋
    in the jar and a little olive oil in the jug. Here I am gathering a few
    pieces of wood, and I will go and prepare it for me and my son, that we
    might eat it and die.” 13 Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid. Go and do
    according to your word; only make for me a small bread cake from it first,
    and bring it out to me. Make it for yourself and for your son afterward.
    14 For thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘The jar of flour will not be
    emptied and the jug of olive oil will not run out until the day Yahweh
    gives rain on the surface of the earth.’ ” 15 So she went and did according
    to the word of Elijah; then both she and he ate with her household for many
    days. 16 The jar of flour was not emptied and the jug of olive oil did not
    run out, according to the word of Yahweh which he spoke by the hand of
    Elijah.
