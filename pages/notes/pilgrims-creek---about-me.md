# Hello

This is my snippet for [website]() for [[pilgrims-creek]] I need to write a little intro
about myself so I'll mind-dump some things here and then organize into a blurb
to put on the website

Nic is a man first and foremost defined by the grace of Jesus Christ, and a
grateful husband (13 years and counting) and father of two wonderful daughters. He works in tech as a
platform engineer, building tools to support developers and improve their
experience. Beyond his professional life, Nic is passionate about exploring
technology – especially through his homelab – and how it intersects with
homelabbing and privacy conerns intersect.

A lifelong student of theology, Nick also finds joy in physical pursuits like volleyball and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (currently a blue belt!).
He shares his thoughts on these passions at [pype.dev](https://pype.dev). Here at Pilgrim’s
Creek, Nic hopes to foster energizing conversations rooted in the Lordship of
Jesus, celebrating His grace and the joy it brings – a place for rest, peace,
and acknowledging God’s goodness.
