1 John 3: 7-10 for men's group in August 2025

???+ note "1 John 3: 7-10"

    7 Little children, let no one deceive you: the one who practices
    righteousness is righteous, just as that one is righteous. 8 The one who
    practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the
    beginning. For this reason the Son of God was revealed: in order to destroy the
    works of the devil. 9 Everyone who is fathered by God does not practice sin,
    because his seed resides in him, and he is not able to sin, because he has been
    fathered by God. 10 By this the children of God and the children of the devil
    are evident: everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God,
    namely, the one who does not love his brother.

## Interesting notes

- we will avoid cheap questions that assume black and white understanding of the passage
  "the one who practices sin if of the devil" does not mean that sinning one time means you're not saved... put the juvenile things behind us
- "the devil has been sinning from the beginning"
  - from the beginning of what?
  - has he really been sinning the entire time? don't we have mythology about Lucifer being an angel of light??? (note the heavy sarcasm from me here...)
