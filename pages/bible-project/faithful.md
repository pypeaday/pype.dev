Related to "Amen" which is untranslated Hebrew expression meaning "that's truth"

## Stability

Moses has to hold his hands up when Israel faces the Amalekites. Joshua (and another) bring Moses a rock to sit on and hold is hands up so they could be Emet.

Abraham considers God Emet, he He'Emin's God and God blesses this by creating Isreal.

Israel, In Exodus 14:31, He'Emin's God (until they see the gians in Canaan that is)

1 Kings 1:6 says David walked in Emet with God

2 Samuel 7:16, God blesses David and says his kingdom will have Emet

Romans 15:8-9 says Jesus came on behalf of God's faithfulness.

# Questions

!!! note "1"

    The Hebrew word “emet” is translated with words like “faithful,”
    “reliable,” “sure,” “trustworthy,” and “amen.” Read aloud Psalm 36:5-6 ,
    Psalm 19:7 , and Psalm 41:13 and discuss what the psalmists are
    communicating in these passages when they use the word “emet.”

!!! scripture "Psalms 36:5-6"

    5Your lovingkindness, O Lord, extends to the heavens,

    Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.

    6Your righteousness is like the mountains of God;

    Your judgments are like a great deep.

    O Lord, You preserve man and beast.


!!! scripture "Psalms 19:7"

    7The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul;

    The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.


!!! scripture "Psalms 41:13"


    13Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,

    From everlasting to everlasting.

    Amen and Amen.


I think the lesson here is pretty simple - God is faithful, full stop. His
faithfulness doesn't look necessarily like how we might want... when I was a
kid I would be upset if my parents didn't respond to me in the way I wanted,
and my kids will certainly share that disappointment. But I am faithful to my
children - sometimes the main issue is a child's outlook on a situation or
worldview. I think that metaphor holds true in relation to humans and Yahweh -
he sees the whole world, we see a part of it so we cannot understand
faithfulness fully, in the same way that my children can't understand my
faithfulness to them fully - even to the point of being upset or thinking that
_I'm not being faithful_

!!! note "2"

    God promised the Israelites that he would give them a king of peace that
    would rule forever and ever (e.g. 2 Samuel 7:16). However, Israel’s kingdom
    collapsed and they found themselves without a home or a king. Compare the
    beginning of Psalm 89 (vv. 1-10) with the way it closes (vv. 46-52). What
    do you think it practically looks like to trust God when all seems lost?

!!! scripture "2 Samuel 7:16"

    16Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever.” ’ ”

!!! scripture "PSALM 89"

    The Lord’s Covenant with David, and Israel’s Afflictions.

    A Maskil of Ethan the Ezrahite.

    1I will sing of the lovingkindness of the Lord forever;

    To all generations I will make known Your faithfulness with my mouth.

    2For I have said, “Lovingkindness will be built up forever;

    In the heavens You will establish Your faithfulness.”

    3“I have made a covenant with My chosen;

    I have sworn to David My servant,

    4I will establish your seed forever

    And build up your throne to all generations.” Selah.

    5The heavens will praise Your wonders, O Lord;

    Your faithfulness also in the assembly of the holy ones.

    6For who in the skies is comparable to the Lord?

    Who among the sons of the mighty is like the Lord,

    7A God greatly feared in the council of the holy ones,

    And awesome above all those who are around Him?

    8O Lord God of hosts, who is like You, O mighty Lord?

    Your faithfulness also surrounds You.

    9You rule the swelling of the sea;


!!! note "3"

    Ultimately, God answers the psalmist’s cries in the person of Jesus. Compare 2 Samuel 7:16
    2 Samuel 7:16

    16Your house and your kingdom shall endure before Me forever; your throne shall be established forever.” ’ ”

    to Hebrews 1:8-9
    Hebrews 1:8-9

    8But of the Son He says,

    “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,

    And the righteous scepter is the scepter of His kingdom.

    9You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness;

    Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You

    With the oil of gladness above Your companions.”

    . How does King Jesus embody and fulfill the ancient promises of God (e.g. John 1:14
    John 1:14

    The Word Made Flesh

    14And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we saw His glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.

    , Hebrews 3:5-6
    Hebrews 3:5-6

    5Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later; 6but Christ was faithful as a Son over His house—whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end.

    , and Romans 15:8-9
    Romans 15:8-9

    8For I say that Christ has become a servant to the circumcision on behalf of the truth of God to confirm the promises given to the fathers, 9and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written,

    “Therefore I will give praise to You among the Gentiles,

    And I will sing to Your name.”

    Read Hebrews 10:22-25
    Hebrews 10:22-25

    22let us draw near with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. 23Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful; 24and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, 25not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near.

    , Hebrews 11
    Hebrews 11

    The Triumphs of Faith

    1Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. 2For by it the men of old gained approval.

    3By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible. 4By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained the testimony that he was righteous, God testifying about his gifts, and through faith, though he is dead, he still speaks. 5By faith Enoch was taken up so that he would not see death; and he was not found because God took him up; for he obtained the witness that before his being taken up he was pleasing to God. 6And without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him. 7By faith Noah, being warned by God about things not yet seen, in reverence prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, by which he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.

    8By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going. 9By faith he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise; 10for he was looking for the city which has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 11By faith even Sarah herself received ability to conceive, even beyond the proper time of life, since she considered Him faithful who had promised. 12Therefore there was born even of one man, and him as good as dead at that, as many descendants as the stars of heaven in number, and innumerable as the sand which is by the seashore.

    13All these died in faith, without receiving the promises, but having seen them and having welcomed them from a distance, and having confessed that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. 14For those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a country of their own. 15And indeed if they had been thinking of that country from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to return. 16But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; for He has prepared a city for them.

    17By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was offering up his only begotten son; 18it was he to whom it was said, “In Isaac your descendants shall be called.” 19He considered that God is able to raise people even from the dead, from which he also received him back as a type. 20By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things to come. 21By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff. 22By faith Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel, and gave orders concerning his bones.

    23By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw he was a beautiful child; and they were not afraid of the king’s edict. 24By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, 25choosing rather to endure ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin, 26considering the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt; for he was looking to the reward. 27By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing Him who is unseen. 28By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that he who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. 29By faith they passed through the Red Sea as though they were passing through dry land; and the Egyptians, when they attempted it, were drowned.

    30By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. 31By faith Rahab the harlot did not perish along with those who were disobedient, after she had welcomed the spies in peace.

    32And what more shall I say? For time will fail me if I tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets, 33who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, 34quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. 35Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection; 36and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment. 37They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated 38(men of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground.

    39And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised, 40because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect.

    , and Hebrews 12:1-3
    Hebrews 12:1-3

    Jesus, the Example

    1Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.

    3For consider Him who has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.

    . After reading these passages, name one example of what it looks like to put our trust in God.
