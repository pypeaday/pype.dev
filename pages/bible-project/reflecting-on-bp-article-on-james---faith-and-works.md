# Intro

> This started as one of [[my-thoughts]] and got long enough to warrant putting right in the blog

Faith and works is a common point of conversation for Christians who like
debating things, and I'm at the point in my life where I'm kind of over the
debates and the simplistic thinking.... but this morning I saw this article and
wanted to give it a read

## Article

[Article Link](https://bibleproject.com/articles/what-does-faith-without-works-dead-mean-james-214-26) - 11 minute read

One of the best pieces from the article is:

!!! info ""
    James illuminates and clarifies our understanding of faith by bypassing
    questions about whether one has (or does not have) faith and focusing instead
    on whether a personâ€™s faith is living or dead.

## Reflection

This snippet isn't incredibly profound on its own, but in my experience it hits hard
I've been in many conversations about faith and works - and as I've written
about before in [[a-new-perspective-on-being-god-s-child]] Christians
today have a deep desire to put things into neat and simple boxes but this is
often a mistake. 
And in the case of faith and works I think it's just as
prevalent for similar reasons I outlined in that post - a deep "need" to "fully
understand" a system we participate in. 
However this usually comes lacking the accompanying nuance in understanding
"works" and "works of the law" and "work in order to be saved".

!!! warning "To be very clear"
    The Bible is in no way contradictory in its teaching about faith and works
    and salvation regardless of how wrong someone gets it... at the end of the day
    Jesus picks who he picks. This in no way excuses the elect from performing good
    works, but any good or bad "works" do nothing to change the reality of
    salvation - the works merely reveal the truth

I don't see tension in faith and works - James' statement "faith without works
is dead" is so simple to me...
Jesus changes my life every day, and every day I make decisions based on that
reality. 
If I only talked about my faith, and never made a decision where I
prioritized my faith over what I wanted - then do I really believe? 

!!! danger "The answer is simple"
    Of course not.
