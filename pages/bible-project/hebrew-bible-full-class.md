# 01 The Shape of the Hebrew Bible

## Session 1: What on Earth is the Hebrew Bible?

This class is not so much a survey of the HB, it is Tim's attempt to distil the
most helpful things for understanding it in a consumable way for laypeople.

A chunk of this is the other people giving some of their own background. One
lady said something that might be helpful for ministry - "Maybe that thing that
I saw as 'you don't love me' is 'I don't know how to love you'"

!!! note "how to love"
    
    Maybe that thing that I saw as 'you don't love me' is 'I don't know how to love you'

!!! danger "Christian coping strategy for the Olt Testament"

    1. Hero-example model
        * Stories get isolated and distilled down into a simple moral model, where the hero is just the hero. 
        * Veggie-Tales is uber-guilty of this nonsense
        * There's something correct about this - but the oversimplification usually comes out of a massive re-writting of the stories, then anyone raised on those versions of the story is scaldalized when they read it for real

    2. Poltical-authority source
        * Political parties hijacking "The Bible says X about Y" as a means to harvest authority from a book that many people claim is authoritative.

    3. Theology answer book model
        * Treating the Bible like a dictionary of key/value pairs where keys are questions and values are simple answers.
        * This ignores narrative, and general literacy.
        * The instinct may be right - the Bible should profoundly shape my view of everything, but it isn't simple

    4. Inspirational-heart-warming model
        * Verse-a-day calendars
        * Jermiah 29:11

!!! warning ""

    Are we imposing a set of questions that are foreign to what the authors are
    trying to communicate? do we need to set our cultural agendas aside to just
    listen?

A result of asking the wrong questions is the common story of people's faith being dismantled _by reading the Bible_

!!! note "DL Baker - Two Testaments - One Bible"

    One of the most fundamental questions which has faced theology and the
    Church in every age... is whether or not Christianity also needs an Old
    Testament. Is the Old Testament to be thrown away as obsolete, or pre-
    served as a relic from days of yore, or treasured as a classic and read by
    scholars, or used occasionally as a change from the New Testament, or
    kept in a box in case it should be needed some day? Or is the Old Testa-
    ment an essential part of the Christian Bible, with continuing validity along-
    side the New Testament? — 

## Session 2: How Jesus and the Apostle ReadTheir Bibles

The Bible most often refers to itself as *the Writings*

!!! note "Road to Emmaus"

    Jesus confronts a couple guys walking to Emmaus after he is resurrected and
    more or less calls them idiots/fools for not understanding that the
    Writings point to an annointed king who will suffer death for the sake of
    redemption. He's recognized by them once their eyes are opened then he vanishes

__Weird stuff__

### Paul and Timothy

Paul assumes when writing to Timothy that he, and probably believers in general, are in a community of people who are regularly learning about Yahweh through the Scriptures _as a family_

!!! scripture "2 Timothy 3:15-16"

    ... and that from childhood you ahve known the sacred writings which are
    able to give you the wisdom that leas to salvation through faith which is
    in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for
    teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness

!!! success ""

    For Paul, the `Scriptures` here are our OT, the Hebrew Bible. For Paul, the HB
    is entirely _wisdom literature_ that leads to salvation through Jesus

The question of "What are the Scriptures?" is covered in the next session

__To answer the question 'How do we read the HB?' we have to ask the question
'Whose book is the HB?'__

## Session 3: Shape of the Scriptures

`Old Testament` is the Christian term for a set of writings that comprise about
3/4 of the Christian Bible. The authors themselves though refer to those
writings as `the Scriptures`. One time it is called `the Old Covenant` by Paul
, but he's talking about Synagogue readings of the Torah portion in synagogues.
THe phrase `Hebrew Bible` is a modern term that is a bit more neutral.

> So, what is our Bible?

!!! scripture "Luke 24:25-27"

    25 And he said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of
    heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! 26 Was it not necessary
    that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?”
    27 And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in
    all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.  

> Moses and the Prophets

### TaNaK

Jweish reference to the books in our OT, in the Hebrew Bible, but the arangement is different...

!!! note "TaNaK"

    1. T = Torah (first 5 books)
    2. N - Nevi'im (Prophets: Joshua - Kings) [Christians often call these the 'historial books']
    3. K - Ketuvim

    | **Torah** | **Pentateuch** |
    | --- | --- | 
    | Genesis - Exodus - Leviticus - Numbers Deuteronomy | Genesis - Exodus - Leviticus - Numbers - Deuteronomy |
    | **Nevi'im - The Prophets** | **History** |
    | *Former Prophets* <br/> Joshua - Judges - Samueal - Kings | Joshua - Judges - Ruth <br/> 1-2 Samuel - 1-2 Kings <br/> 1-2 Chronicles <br/> Ezra - Nehemiah - Ester |
    | *Later Prophets* <br/> Isaiah - Jeremiah - Ezekiel <br/> Hosea - Joel - Amos - Obadiah - Jonah - Micah - Nahum - Habakkuk - Zephaniah - Haggai - Zechariah - Malachi | **Poetry** <br/> Job - Psalms - Proverbs - Ecclesiastes - Song of Solomon |
    | **Kethuvim - The Writings** | **Prophets** |
    | Psalms - Job - Proverbs <br/> Ruth - Song of Songs - Ecclesiastes - Lamentations - Esther [The Megillot] <br/> Daniel - Ezra - Nehemiah - Chronicles | Isiah - Jeremiah - Lamentations <br/> Ezekiel - Daniel <br/> Hosea - Joel - Amos - Obadiah - Jonah - Micah - Nahum - Habakkuk - Zephaniah - Haggai - Zechariah - Malachi |

!!! scripture "Luke 11:49–51 (ESV) "

    49 Therefore also the Wisdom of God said, ‘I will send them prophets and
    apostles, some of whom they will kill and persecute,’ 50 so that the blood
    of all the prophets, shed from the foundation of the world, may be charged
    against this generation, 51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of
    Zechariah, who perished between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell
    you, it will be required of this generation. 

> Blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah...

Why would Jesus pick these two events? Abel is murdered on page 4, Zechariah is
murdered in the last part of Chronicles, which in the TaNaK is significant...
Jesus is saying that _all the prophets from the beginning of the Scriptures to
the end_... All the prophets from A-Z so to speak


!!! note "Scriptures"

    "Books" as we know it, bound papers with writing on it, called a 'codex'
    wasn't a thing until a couple hundred years post-Jesus... so when the
    authors say "The Scriptures" we need to keep in mind that Jews had the
    scriptures in their minds and hearts, not on paper (save for a couple very
    expensive scrolls). So the structure of the scriptures is also apart of the
    Jewish being... This interaction with the Scriptures is _very very very
    different than how we interact with the Bible_

!!! note "4QMMT"

    "The scrolls of Moses, the words of the prophets, and of David."

!!! note "Philo of Alexandria"

    The laws and the oracles given by inspiration through the prophets and the
    Psalms, and the other scrolls whereby knowledge and piety are increased and
    completed...

    - De Vita Contemplatetiva, 25

### Melito of Sardis

- Early 200s 
- One of the earliest Christians to talk about the books/scrolls of Christian scriptures
- Summarizes _Christian ordering_ of the Hebrew Bible with some logic
    * Foundation narrative of the Pentateuch
    * History
    * Poetry
    * Prophets then point forward to the coming Messiah, Jesus, and the NT writings

## Session 4 - Seams between Texts in the Dead Sea Scrolls

Around 100-200 AD there was a split in the Jewish community over things like
how the Temple and sacrifices were to be run, etc. A group got kicked out, so
they grabbed some scrolls and went to start what we'd think of as a Monastic
community. Qumran community is where they went, and the scrolls this group
managed are called the Dead Sea Scrolls.

Out of DSS we have some of the oldest biblical scrolls, they have their own
writings and liturgies since they were all priests basically too.

The scrolls were hidden in caves before the Romans marched on Qumran. They were
found in the 1940s by a bunch of shepherds. A few showed up online for sale and
that's how we found out about their exitence.... These scrolls give us
pre-Christian Jewish Bible nerds...

Qumran community didn't know about Jesus - they thought the Messiah would be a
man called _The Teacher of Righteousness_

### Scroll-making

The DSS preserved for us, not only ancient biblical texts, but also the method
by which scrolls were created. They were well-preserved papyrus that was
stiched together - literal stitches. We also have obvious additions from Qumran
community as well as notes from priests and corrections from missed
transcribing.

### Our Bible

The DSS scrolls, being the oldest stitched together set of scrolls, teach us
how scrolls and collections of ancient holy texts were put together. We need to
keep this in mind when we think about where our Christian Bible came from

The beginning and ending of our books might/are filled with hyperlinks that
call a reader's mind back to other stories. It's the way of linking context and
stories to one another before the writings are in a codex

> Hyperlinks - language/syntax that remind a reader of antoher scroll - help us
> understand the structure of the Hebrew Bible

!!! note "A favorite quote from Tim"

    So, you can see I'm interested in a historical question of like the
    collection [Hebrew Bible] was produced by a group of people. What did they
    mean by it? And we can actually know a lot about what they meant and locate
    them and read it the way they wanted us to read it, and pick up what
    they're saying. And, lo and behold, you know, I hope to convince you
    that—and this is all pre-Christian—what's happening here and what this all
    points to and means, fits hand in glove with how Jesus and Paul and the
    apostles talk about these texts. 
    So that's different from saying nobody
    knew what these texts meant. The events of Jesus happen, and then we go
    reread it, and it has a whole new meaning that no one has ever imagined. It
    seems to me what actually happened in history was a little more interesting
    and complicated than that.  [17:30-18:21]
