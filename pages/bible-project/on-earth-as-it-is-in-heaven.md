## Meditation

Sermon on the mount is chiastic

> 3 main parts to the Sermon on the Mount
> The middle part has 3 parts
> Each of those parts has 3 parts

### Climax

The center of the chiasm is a famous prayer

“Our Father in Heaven, may your name be treated as holy. May your Kingdom come. May your will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven.”9

> 9. Matthew 6:9-10

## Jewishness

God's kingdom was to be ushered into the world by his creation, but Genesis
3,6,10 tell us that humans choose wrong when we define good and bad by
ourselves. Yahweh chose Abraham and built up Israel as a second attempt of
sorts to bring the his Kingdom to earth but the HB is filled with the story of
how they mostly failed.

NT time is where Jesus reveals the Kingdom to Jews who are oppressed by Roman
Empire and he reveals this to exactly the oppressed audience - "Blessed are the
poor in spirit"
