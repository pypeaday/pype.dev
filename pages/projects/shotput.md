This is from [[i-built-a-simple-app-for-adding-images-to-my-blog]]

## Overview

Shotput is a simple webapp backed by a git repo that allows you to paste a screenshot from your clipboard, it gets put into the repo and pushed, and you get a link back to using that image via statically's CDN in your website.

## Example

pasting an image let's you copy the markdown link for easy pasting

```

## Concerns

Currently this is deployed with an ssh key mounted into the container that I
put into a zfs dataset manually. Per [[2025-07-16-notes#Wants]] I'm struggling
with the key sharing model...
