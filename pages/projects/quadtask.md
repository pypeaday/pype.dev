QuadTask is a simple productivity app that I'm sure will bring in $0 towards my retirement but a few friends use it and it's a fun project to use as fodder for learning how to pair program with AI.

~~The app is live here - [quadtask.app](https://quadtask.app)~~

The app is live here - [quadtask.fly.dev](https://quadtask.fly.dev)

## Updates

2. retire quadtask.app and just have it live on fly

## New Updatess

- Rebuild as a notifiq app
  - includes translating quadtask's schema into event.content or adding tables to notifiq
