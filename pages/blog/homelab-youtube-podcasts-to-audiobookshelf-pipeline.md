I wrote about using [[homelab-pinchflat]] for at-home mashup creation and a song flow
for church. But I use it for more than, that and here's another prime use case

There are podcasts on YouTube I want to follow - The Standup with Prime, or
Shawn Ryan's show. Basically I use pinchflat to download the audio and serve up
those files in ABS (audiobookshelf)
