I could've sworn I had a chili list going but alas...

# 2025-10-04

2 lbs ground beef
1 big can of pinto beans
3 small cans of black beans
3 cans diced tomatoes
2 onions diced

This is last minute chili for church pot-luck... poor planning

I browned the meat and seasoned similar to how I might for tacos, but lighter on cumin and added chili powder.

Dumped the browned meant, tomtoes, and beans into crock pot. Seasoned with a healthy amount of garlic powder, chili powder, cumin, and salt.
Browned the onions, and dumped in.
Let stew for a few hours.
Eat.

## Review

- 1 bowl was great. The yellow onion still seem to add a little bit of heat, maybe could've sauteed them longer
