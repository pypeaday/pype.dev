My moonlander is great, and I just recently added CAPS LOCK back to my keymapping but I've moved it...
At present it is where the ESC kep usually is however I'm trying to match my general moonlander usage with a keymap that fits on a planck.

Because of this though I keep turning CAPS LOCK on without meaning too by thinking I'm hitting ESC, so while I learn the keymapping I need a way to know if I screwed up...
