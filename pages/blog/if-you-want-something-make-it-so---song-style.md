In grad school a professor of mine, Mark Hunacek, said one of the most profound
things I've ever heard to the tune "if you want it, then make it so"... It's a
great benefit to mathematicians at the bar to start a conversation with "hey
let's assume X because we can"...

This phrase has affected my work greatly to the work I do and how I go about it- 
it's literally changed how I design some of my code. But I also want this
mantra to flow into other parts of my life...

In this example I took a Goobsie mashup, cut the part I didn't like quite as
much (though admittedly it's still beautiful) and spliced it with itself to
give me a longer running version of a musical piece that takes me to another
world...

## Acquiring the Media

Pinchflat isn't really necessary here, anyone can use `youtubedl` or another
tool to download from YouTube. I do use Pinchflat to subscribe to Youtube
playlists to automate this process for me. See more about that in
[[homelab-pinchflat]]

## Creating the Mashup

So Goobsie makes actually good mashups, and I'm not anything even remotely close to an audio engineer or whatever, but there's a segment of this song that just strikes my whole body in a unique way and I want to sometimes just listen to it conveniently... So enter Davinci Resolve... Basically I took the downloaded file, added it twice to a timeline, and then faded in and out until it sounded ok to me.

## Listening to the Mashup

So now how do I listen to this?

For the moment, it's a favorite in my Jellyfin library and I listen through
that client. It's a TODO item for me to set-up a more music-centric streaming
service
