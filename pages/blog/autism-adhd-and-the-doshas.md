# Introduction

I was recently diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder Level 1 and ADHD, the inattentive
type. I suppose, AuDHD for short.
There are many reasons why I now have this official label of AuDHD, not that I
was hoping for it, but due to a childhood behavioral disorder diagnosis and a
desire to understand myself better, I decided to start considering that something
in my childhood issue was misunderstood.

!!! note ""
    But what started as simply considering some new diagnosis turned into a
    larger worldview shift when it comes to medicine and how we treat people for
    things we label disorderly.

## Personal History

A brief history lesson for context is that I was diagnosed with bipolar
disorder, but not specifically type 1 or type 2. This diagnosis came about two
times, once in my late childhood and again when I was 19.
The diagnosis never made a ton of sense to me, but it seemed to almost match some of
the things that my mom specifically was concerned about.
There is another point for later on, which is that part of me wanted to be bipolar.
I felt like it would be cool, but also it made me special.

!!! warning "bias"
    There's no way that this desire didn't turn into massive confirmation bias
    in getting this diagnosis as a kid and as a late teenager.

Once I started kind of thinking *for myself* a little bit - the bipolar diagnosis
was one of my first spiritual challenges in understanding the brokenness of
humanity.

## The Challenge

I believe in an orderly God, the creator of all things, who makes things both
soundly and reasonable. Mental health is complex because it's not like a broken
arm, throw a cast on, and wait... Taking medicine felt almost antithetical to
my worldview because I had a deep desire to see
something miraculous. So, I backed myself into this odd worldview where I
taking medicine must be fighting something that God wants to do in me with this
brokenness. I felt like I was trying to do something maybe God didn't want me to
do, but was also wrestling with "but if something's really wrong (which is
possible because we live in a broken world) God gifts these doctors to come up
with this medicine to help heal some of the brokenness."

So I had these two competing ideas that were very loud in my head.

!!! note ""
    In hindsight, an AuDHD diagnosis somewhat explains this behavior of mine.
    Wherein I wanted to be sick, and I had these competing ideas about the
    character of God.

So I've been more at less at peace with the idea that behavior disorders are
apart of life for many people - and that medical treatment can be helpful.

# Reflection

As I've gotten older and reflected on being bi-polar I couldn't help but notice
that hardly any part of the atypical
pieces of myself matched up with bi-polar at all... Around the time I started
to notice this my wife began wondering if I had something more akin to ADD. We
didn't really understand what that meant, or how it has changed over the years,
or any of it - but based on some initial stereotypes ADHD began to become a
common thing we discussed
After some more legitimate research we both became pretty convinced that I was
measurably on the Autism Spectrum and that certainly there were ADHD tendencies
that negatively affected my life. I talked with my doctor and after several
psych evaluations it turns out that my self-diagnosis was consistent with the
conclusion of the evaluation. So if this was the end then my thought would've
been 

!!! note "I'm not bi-polar"
    ok I'm not bi-polar, I'm AuDHD - there's some coping mechanisms I can
    learn now and things make sense.

However, this wasn't the end for me - getting diagnosed with AuDHD
didn't/hasn't changed my life - it's given me a framework by which I can
understand myself in the context of our
Western world better.
But there's a lot more here and as we look ahead, I want to be clear that I
take no special pride in the AuDHD label...
I'll talk about myself with this label as a way of communicating with people who
understand it, but the main point of this post will be in how understanding
myself as a human being more holistically led to a different point of view of
what the West calls neurodivergencies.

# Treatment

I have been taking a light mood stabilizer for a while now per my former
bi-polar diagnosis. There's no doubt that it is coincidentally a helpful tool
in coping with some debilitating aspects of AuDHD but the more I reflect the
more I want to get away from it - personally.

I'm not sure what to think about treatment overall... I recognize that some folks are
much more negatively affected by the tendencies we label as neurodivergent and
that there are meaningful changes that can come from modern western medicine.
However, there's also old/ancient and natural solutions to many problems that I
think are often overlooked 

!!! quote "Simple doesn't mean easy"
    often exercise and cleaner eating can treat depression and anxiety for
    example. That doesn't mean the anxiety wasn't significant or legitimate, but
    it's not like a pharmaceutical is the only option for treating something
    legitimate.

!!! warning "The other side"
    I also see that obviously there are severe cases of Autism - I think we
    should better understand where that comes from, and I wouldn't ever claim
    that just drinking some tea and figuring out an exercise regime can cure
    something that is fully debilitating.

!!! note "Las drogas"
    I think where I have the biggest issues with "treatment" is that taking
    mental health medication is a fad today... it doesn't mean it's not helpful,
    but our culture glorifies taking drugs as long as they come from a
    pharmaceutical company. I've personally come across this as I've shared my
    struggles and official AuDHD diagnosis with some friends -  and it's clear that
    some of them give these ads and medicines every ounce of their faith and
    that's frankly concerning in its own way
    
## Two Systems | East v West

I've become critical of the modern Western perspective on neurodivergence
and mental/behavioral health. It's primarily that I'd be much less skeptical if
it wasn't for all the money... I notice patterns as well that I don't find
comforting - such as the focus on symptoms and isolated treatment of them or
groups of symptoms rather than looking at a human-being as an entire organism or
system. 
I know that certain pieces of a system can break, and sometimes treating
those isolated breakages is the way to go - but also we (in the West) seem to
avoid thinking about ourselves as 1 whole thing... There's language that
younger people use about their "whole self" but honestly I only see them talk
about sexuality as if that defined everything about a person... that's 100% not
what I have in mind here... 

Every one of my psychiatric appointments up through the last few years had never
sought to get me off my medication... It got me thinking the goal was for me to be
a customer for life. I don't like being reliant on anything external and the
fact that there was never a goal for me to be self-sufficient in my own health
became troubling.

My philosophical issues arising with our modern medical systems have led me
to becoming more open to Eastern medicine and as I explore how those systems
have historically analyzed patterns and attributed those patterns to different
ways of thinking, I think the pattern-analysis and subsequent recommendations
can be extremely valuable. This is where adaptogens come in for me.

## Lifestyle Changes

I'd heard of Lion's Mane via some Joe Rogan clips (have become a bigger and
bigger fan of him over the last few years), and then got a subscription to
FourSigmatic which is a coffee company that offers mushroom-replacement and
supplements for coffee and tea basically. So I'm drinking coffee with Lion's
Mane, and have added a few other mushroom tinctures with Reishi and Chaga
specifically, as well as Eleuthero and Turkey Tail as a means of introducing
adaptogens into my routine and maybe it's confirmation bias again, but as I've
gone on and off the Lion's Mane specifically I notice a significant difference
in my cognitive function... When I'm diligent about putting the Lion's Mane
tincture into my coffee in the morning it is like unlocking on-demand
hyper-focus some mornings...

# Wrapping It Up

This post is mostly a stream-of-consciousness as I reflect on the atpypical
nature of much of my life, how that fits into the modern Western discourse of
mental health, and how the Western perspective might end up not being a helpful lens
through which to process these behavioral issues.

With sufficient context, a faithful summary of my journey is that I don't mind being labeled as AuDHD - there's plenty that's helpful with it. However if an Ayuverdic Shaman "diagnosed" me as a person whose elemental make up was primarily earthy and watery with an odd flare of fire, and that elemental make-up is what explains some of my tendencies (needing to know the correct answer, tunnel-vision and hyper-focus, literal understanding of the world, etc.) then I want to understand that with the same amount of "weight" as being AuDHD.. 

!!! note "TLDR"
    At the end of the day there's multiple ways to label people based on
    observation - either at the micro or macro levels of humanity. I don't think
    that the Western systems of medicine get everything right, and the Eastern
    models have been around for thousands more years so I want to treat them with
    an equal amount of respect and validity
