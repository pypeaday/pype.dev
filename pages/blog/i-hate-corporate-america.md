# Rant

The longer I'm in corporate America - and the longer I homelab and listen to
podcasts - a clich√© truth becomes more and more apparent to me, which
is a lot of people are full of bullshit, and a lot of initiatives are built on
nothing, and a lot of people feel the need to be/feel important.

    That makes it hard to do things and find things that are actually valuable.

So, for this rant to be healthy I suppose I'll muse for a little while on
finding things of value in these contexts that suck.

I want to be thankful for finding things that matter when I'm
forced to participate in contexts that I think are stupid.

# Redemption

So what good has come? The first is financial blessing - I hate that money runs
the worls, but God has given me a skill-set where the work does afford a
moderately comfortable life.

I've met some good friends of faith through the machine that is corporate America,
and the friendships are a source of regular encouragement via The Boys Chat.

I've also met a couple friends of tech (so to speak) and through those
friendships I've discovered fun hobbies which have affected
my family life and home in very positive ways.

!!! note "Ending the rant"
    There can be good redeeming things anywhere, and it's kind of a meme to hate
    corporate America this much, but I really do and I look forward to Heaven
    coming to Earth fully. Until then, gratitude is a good daily practice
