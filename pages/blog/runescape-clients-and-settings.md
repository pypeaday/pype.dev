I'm not a seasoned PC gamer, so launchers and game installers have been a tad
confusing to me over the years. Runescape has some clients now, and [runelite](https://runelite.net) is
apparently the primary third-party one. There are also plugins available! 

## Working On Linux

To start I downloaded a third-party jagex launcher, [bolt](https://github.com/Adamcake/Bolt), from the discover store...
I use it to launch runelite. In runelite there's a plugin menu, I installed the
gpu one and almost instantly the game came alive in a whole new way!

??? note "Jagex Launcher"

    I linked my runescape account to a jagex account and you ahve to use the jagex launcher to launch runelite but the jagex launcher only works on windows - there's a github to make it work on linux but I went with third-party jagex launcher bolt instead

## GPU

The GPU one is great, makes the game look incredible

## Stats

There's a few that give nice timers for resources and stats for skill building

Actions for each skill is the last thing you did that earned XP. So in my
screenshot I was mining iron and I have 10 actions left before leveling up - 1
action is mining 1 iron ore in this case

## End

I'm digging not just playing runescape again, but enjoying the ecosystem of tools around it. At the end of the day I'm realizing games are sets of data, and things like textures and effects can be loaded on top of that and rendered however you want (that the game/plugins support). So I'm very excited to dive back into a childhood favorite and relive the quests but now in GPU-rendered ray-traced goodness

!!! note "It's not ray-traced but it sounded cool"
