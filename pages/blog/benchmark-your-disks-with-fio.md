# Intro

I use ZFS at home in my homelab for basically all of my storage... Docker uses
ZFS backend, all my VMs have their `.qcow2` images in their own zfs datasets,
and all my shares are ZFS datasets. I love ZFS but my home hardware presently
is the opposite of expensive or new... Thankfully I've had a lot of my orginal
homelab simply given to me but the cost of this is that I didn't put my
machines together, I didn't choose the disks, and I definitely didn't do the
research I would've otherwise done had I bankrolled my server personally... 

## The Problem

I run `glances` on basically all my machines and for the longest time I have
been seeing big time `iowait` issues. Now, since everything was free I've
largely been able to ignore that however I'm now after some better performance
which I think means new hardware!

Here is a random screenshot of my glances homepage at time of writing - The
only major load on my server is some `ffmpeg` transcoding (about 60% CPU
utilization)...

As you can see... there's a lot of issues and _I don't even know what they mean_.

# fio

I heard about [fio](https://fio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) through a friend and
decided to try it out quick. It installs with `apt` on ubuntu quick and easy...

Jim Saltar has a good blog post on it [here](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/02/how-fast-are-your-disks-find-out-the-open-source-way-with-fio/)

Basically it's a handy tool for benchmarking your disks and the blog dives into
what types of metrics matter - it's not just throughput, but also latency,
iops, etc.

## Tests

I ran a few basic commands inside a new zfs dataset on my server `tank/fio`

```bash
fio --name=random-write --ioengine=posixaio --rw=randwrite --bs=4k --size=4g --numjobs=1 --runtime=60 --time_based --end_fsync=1 > single-4KiB-random-write.txt
fio --name=random-write --ioengine=posixaio --rw=randwrite --bs=64k --size=256m --numjobs=16 --iodepth=16 --runtime=60 --time_based --end_fsync=1 > 16-parallel-64KiB-random-write.txt
fio --name=random-write --ioengine=posixaio --rw=randwrite --bs=1m --size=16g --numjobs=1 --iodepth=1 --runtime=60 --time_based --end_fsync=1 > single-1MiB-random-write.txt
```

## Results

The single 4 KiB random write:

`WRITE: bw=7836KiB/s (8024kB/s), 7836KiB/s-7836KiB/s (8024kB/s-8024kB/s), io=523MiB (548MB), run=68317-68317msec`

The 16 parallel 64KiB random writes:

`WRITE: bw=93.9MiB/s (98.4MB/s), 5599KiB/s-6303KiB/s (5734kB/s-6454kB/s), io=7642MiB (8013MB), run=81310-81418msec`

The single 1MiB random write:

`WRITE: bw=81.2MiB/s (85.1MB/s), 81.2MiB/s-81.2MiB/s (85.1MB/s-85.1MB/s), io=8177MiB (8574MB), run=100699-100699msec`

# Summary

So I don't fully understand these numbers yet... 80-100 MiB/s isn't super fast
and that's across a parallelized workload... The single threaded workloads have
awful performance so this tells me something is wrong... I have a few ideas...

1. ZFS dataset config options such as `ashift` or the blocksize might be way misconfigured
2. The disks/pool which came from a TrueNAS/FreeBSD machine may have some artifacts that I need to clean up
3. The SAS controller I am using, which I flashed with IT firmware to get it into JBOD mode might be messed up
4. The data cables themselves could be a problem...

Points 3 and 4 are less likely given that the write speed does increase in the parallelized job but I'm a newbie so it's time to dive in!
