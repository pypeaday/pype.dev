I wrote a simple app to sort, tag, and create tickets at home for my github
stars... As of right now I have 1.3k stars and no convenient way to view them
or remember which ones were ones I actually wanted to do something with. This
simple UI makes scrolling the stars list easy, updates is easy, and the kicker
for me is Kanboard integration so I can click a button from the stars UI and
get a ticket made in my kanboard instance so that the work I want to do is in
front of me and not hidden by Github's shockingly HORRIBLE UI.
