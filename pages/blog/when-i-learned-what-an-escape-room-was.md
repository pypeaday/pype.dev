## Set The Stage

I was recently diagnosed with Autism and ADHD. I've written about it and will
plan to write more. As of August 22, 2025 the only published piece is
[[autism-adhd-and-the-doshas]]. This story will recount one of many events in
my life that in hindsight were clear-cut examples of how my brain consumes and
understands reality differently than neuro-typical people...

## Story Time

When I was 24ish I was working at a summer camp as the head of guy's staff (camp consellors).
It was typical for the leadership team to get together the week
before the camp to get to know each other if we didn't, plan activities, etc.
For team building the plan was to go to Chattanooga and do an __escape room__.

I had never heard of an escape room before and I am not being hyperbolic or
obtuse when I tell you that my first thought was of a dungeon. I was told "you
get locked into a room" and I asked "are you tied up?". I'm a little surprised
the ridiculousness of that question didn't prompt more conversation... I love
the folks I served with, and maybe they were conspiring against me, but no one
said anything to bring much clarity to me. And after not getting an actually
straight forward answer to "are you tied up" I decided to just shut my mouth
because everyone else was excited... even though I thought we might be going to
a literal dungeon.

## Trust

I had to exercise so much trust in my friends out of fear of looking stupid but
my inability to understand the words "escape room" any differently, or more
contextually correct, led me to an anxiety filled walk to the lobby of the
first escape room facility I've ever been to. And no, there were not chains
dangling from the ceiling.
