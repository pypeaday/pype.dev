It occured to me that this is my blog... I can write about whatever the heck I want!

## May 2025

Made 2 quesos very similar - they consisted of:

- 1.5 lbs ground beef
- 2 lbs Velveeta (queso blanco or original)
- ~ 0.75 lbs Pepper Jack
- ~ 0.75 lbs Chedder
- 16 oz diced tomatoes
- 8 oz diced chilis
- 6 oz. jar of sliced jalepenos (for the queso blanco)

I basically browned the meat, and combined everything in a foil pan and smoked
for an hour or 2, stirring regularly.

The Queso Blanco one was a little runnier, no doubt due to the added jalepenos.
Both queso's turned out pretty good but could definitely use a lot more heat. I
seasoned the meat with some salt, pepper, garlic, onion powder, cumin. We could
add jalepenos to regular queso for the flavor since there was almost no heat,
and then add serrano or something to the queso blanco to turn the heat up next
time.

Stay tuned to this post somehow for the next update!
