<p>Here's my thought on <a href="https://bibleproject.com/videos/vocab-insight-mammon-wealth">💭 The Meaning of “Mammon” in the Bible | Matthew 6:24</a></p>
<hr />
<p>I spend a fair amount of time thinking about the future, planning and saving, making sure to the best of my ability and capability right now, that my family is financially taken care of for my whole life and beyond.
It's a challenging thing to wrestle with building wealth while understanding Jesus' call to live a life focused on others and Heaven. He certainly never says having wealth is bad or sinful, but the point in this short 1 minute video on mammon was good for me be encouraged by. Mammon (or stuff, possessions, etc) has the tendency to lead people astray into trusting in it... how many times to people straight up freak out when the stock market dips?
But using mammon to care for others is one of the points of Christian living. God has been good to me, and as we seek to be good to others I pray we (my family and I) are bringing glory to his name and not doing anything for our own vanity</p>
