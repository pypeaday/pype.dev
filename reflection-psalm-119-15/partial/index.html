<p>Spurgeon had a good thought here... It is not the act of eating that actually
nourishes our bodies, it is digestion... The same is true for our spiritual
growth - merely listening to a sermon will not transform your heart and life,
the Word of God must be digested and meditated upon to work in our members and
change us.</p>
<p>What is it to go to church every week but never spend time musing upon the
things of God? If you chew your food and spit it out right after the meal what
good did it do you? Maybe you felt good during the songs, liked the taste of
the food, heard something interesting from the pastor, commented on the decor
in the dining room.... but once you leave, do you remember what you ate? Do you
talk about it with those who ate with you? Did you practice cooking that
delicious meal later in the week?</p>
<p>So it is with us and the precepts of the Lord.</p>
<p>The law of God, in light of Jesus, is not a burden any longer. We are free to
follow, free to choose good. But knowing good takes time... a captive isn't
illuminated to all the ways of the free man who saved him the day his bonds are
cut, he must study the new civilization he's brought into - out of slavery and
into freedom, out of death and into life.</p>
<p>And in that new life, Jesus - the embodiment of the law and the perfector of
our faith changes us, molds us, teaches us about good and bad. His word is
sweet and good.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Philippians 4:8</p>
<p>Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honorable, whatever things are right, whatever things are pure, whatever things are pleasing, whatever things are commendable, if there is any excellence of character and if anything praiseworthy, think about these things.</p>

<p>The instruction from Paul is almost too simple... &quot;just think about these
things&quot;. By God's grace I think a lot... <strong>a lot</strong>. My thoughts are often hard
to take hold of, and I'm led rather than leading in what I put my attention
to, but also by God's grace I fixate on the things of God often. This has not
always been, and is not always fun or exciting or without pain.</p>
<p>But we are all gifted by God in different ways, and afflicted in different ways.
An affliction he's permitted in my life is often a blessing to me as my mind
sometimes can't let go of things that are pure and pleasing and commendable.
The overall thing that's on my mind every day is the freedom Jesus offers to
choose good. The choice can only be made by the power of his resurrection, not
by any moral teaching to be gleaned from his sermons as though he's nothing
more than a philosopher.</p>
<div class="admonition success">
<p>He raised me to life, I didn't attend a lecture.</p>
</div>
<p>But what could be sweeter today in our finite lives, than the ability and
freedom to participate in bringing heaven to earth?</p>
<p>We have no means to do this though without meditating on the Lord's precepts...
How else can we know what is pleasing to heaven?</p>
