            <p>Spurgeon picked 1 Kings 19:8 this morning and his meditation was encouraging at
a meta-level. Highlighting to me that we (Christians) in maturity can be
refreshed from any passage of scripture. This isn't because the Bible is magic,
and I believe it should be studied appropriately in context (heavily) in order to
solidify foundational pieces of understanding.</p>
<p>But I also cannot deny that I serve a living God who actively works in the
lives of people - and one way he might do that is to encourage through pastoral
reflection on Biblical truths that may be <strong>brought to mind</strong> though not
necessarily instructed in a passage. This is a specific point of Christian life
that I have been meditating loosely on lately - to be open in my heart to
finding joy and refreshment in Biblical truths that God may bring to mind even
though the &quot;origin&quot; of that thought might be an unrelated passage of Scripture.
This has been the case for a few weeks at this point, and today felt
significant as I read Spurgeon's thoughts on being supplied for the sake of the
Lord's service.</p>

<p>Jezebel is chasing the prophet Elijah who has fled into the wilderness. Elijah
fears for his life and asks Yahweh to simply kill him. Yahweh (well, the <a class="wikilink" href="/Angel-of-Yahweh">Angel-of-Yahweh</a>...
but we'll do that another time) meets him in his distress resting
under a tree - he provides food, water, and protection for Elijah to take a
nap. He does it again and then tells Elijah to travel to Horeb.</p>

<p>Elijah is faithful to the Lord, and finds himself tired and in need. Yahweh
meets him, feeds him, and then <strong>gives him more work to do</strong>. This is the point
of Spurgeon's writing this morning, that every ounce of work should be poured
out unto the Lord's service. Every single thing I do should be laced with songs
of praise to the King. It's easy to say &quot;blessed be the Name of the Lord&quot; when
I am in surplus, and even in trial and want I think my faith has been tested
and proven to some non-trivial degrees... But what about when I'm tired? Do I
seek rest as a means to be refreshed <strong>unto his service</strong>? Or do I seek a
hollow shell of rest, one that in reality isn't restorative and refreshing, but
is instead deadening and numbing... I think I find myself actively pushing
against holy rest out of love for, and slavery to myself. Maybe not quite to
doom and selfish as to say &quot;myself&quot; only, but out of fear of something else -
maybe as trivial as failure.</p>
<p>God is bringing to my mind why I haven't built more, why I'm disconnected from
work, why I zonk out so much... If I accept refreshment - physical refreshment-
through a God-given grace then I am duty-bound to use it wisely... But I find
that I am afraid of the daunting work of doing something well, and day to day I
find myself hesitant to accept the refreshment out of an abandonment of the
good that can come through the hard work of doing it well.</p>
<p>God is telling me to eat and drink, to be refreshed... I genuinely believe God
is speaking to me through 1 King 19:8 - to take the strength he provides via
the channels I know he provides them, and to wisely-steward the work he's given
me to do.</p>
<p>This week I've pre-planned to dedicate time away from work to my own project
and I feel encouraged going into tomorrow almost with foreknowledge of the
strength God will offer me in the morning</p>
