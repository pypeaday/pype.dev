<p>Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
</div>
<p>The last 3 weeks of Advent are summarized right here in verse 13. Yahweh is the
God of hope, of expectation, he brings Joy through redemption, and Peace to the
believer through faith. That Joy and Peace lead us to &quot;abound in hope&quot;
ourselves, by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>What a dense sentence...</p>
<p>The last several days and months have been heavy, and praise God for Christmas
and Advent right now, which is daily reorienting my eyes to Jesus. I'm waking
up everyday thinking about work, the next thing to do, my next project,
retirement, why am I so sweaty in the morning?... But after a few deep breaths,
eventually making my way to my desk with a cup of coffee and a sense of
direction to start my day, I've been sitting down and reflecting not just on
some random passage from a devotional, but through this Advent season
regularly, daily, reflecting on the core themes. By God's grace this has been a
great gift to me, and without this daily (or mostly daily) reorientation, I am
sure the stress I do still feel would be multiplied by orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>We light the Love candle tomorrow, but today is good for me to wrap up the last
3 weeks with this simple verse. I know God loves me, this next week of
reflection I look forward to what he shares with me. And today the Word of God
reminds me that hope, joy, and peace are apart of God's design for our lives.
Those things are found and fulfilled in the Person and Work of Jesus. He then
left us the helper, the Holy Spirit, to carry us forward while we wait for his
return. Today, it's in the Spirit's power that God's hope may overflow our
hearts, and if we... if I am overflowing with hope and love and peace in Jesus,
then I sure hope more that the &quot;Christmas Cheer&quot; God gives to me does a
partnering work in bringing Heaven to earth while we expectantly wait for the
return of the King.</p>
