I've been learning a lot just about basic web-development as I work on my blog. I'm not actively learning the ins and outs to be honest - AI is both helpful and harmful in this regard for me I think - but in that knowledge-gathering and experience-gaining I've gotten my head around deploying a static site to a simple web server and how that's different than deploying a simple container with a backend. 
I use cloudflare for my DNS already, and I have an app or 2 on fly - but depending on the IaC support for container deployment that are now available with cloudflare I may look to switch...

I suppose I should do a little PoC first, and so this thought will be a reminder to take a stab at it
