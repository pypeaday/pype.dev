Here's my thought on <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/build-backend/">ðŸ’­ Build backend | uv</a>

---

uv build backend ready for production! Dang... I need to visit my hatch builds, I love hatch's simplicity specifically with versioning...  Not sure if it's worth actually switching to uv for my builds or not, but it is dang cool to see astral take on the python space with unbelievable improvements
