## Reflection

- [[reflection---galatians-5-1]]

## Projects

- Been thinking a lot about soonish, it feels like my thoughts are 3 dimensional but I can only clearly see 2 dimensions at a time... 
  - documentation efforts have been a good exercise in a lot of things including developing skill working alongside AI
  - basic desire is Notifications as a Service but can be built into anything from event invites to IT tickets

- revamped [[dad-can-i-wear-this]] for a version 2
