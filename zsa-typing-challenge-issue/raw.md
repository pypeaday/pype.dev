# ZSA

I love [zsa](https://zsa.io) and have been using a moonlander for a few years now.

They recently launched [typ.ing](https://typ.ing) as a way to train your typing skills - it's a lot like [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com).

I have a thought about it [here](https://thoughts.waylonwalker.com/post/682)

## Today's Challenge

I went to do today's daily challenge and have ran into an issue where part of
the challenge is to type `/` the forward slash character but it's actually a
keybind on the website for navigation (well done btw!)

So when I try to type the challenge I actually bring up the nav menu

So for today I'll take the error on the character to complete it and maybe ZSA
can look into this?
