            <p>This morning I finally felt some motivation for a short Bible Project video.
The app is great (💯 would recommend) and gives me daily reminders that are
unobtrusive.</p>
<p>The passage is Matthew 7:1-2</p>

And with the measure that you measure, it will be measured to you. <span class="nv">```</span>

<span class="nv">There are some personal things going on for me as I wrestle and work through an</span>
<span class="nv">AuDHD diagnosis and there&#39;s a lot for me having grown up as a (almost</span>
<span class="nv">certainly) undiagnosed mild-autistic. These 2 verses are in a larger section of</span>
<span class="nv">Scripture called &quot;The Sermon on the Mount&quot;, Jesus starts it by basically saying</span>
<span class="nv">he&#39;ll summarize the Law and Prophets in Matthew 5, then concludes it in Matthew</span>
<span class="nv">7 by saying he summed them up with what we call the Golden Rule - `do unto</span>
<span class="nv">others as you would have them do unto you` is how my Souther Baptist Grandma</span>
<span class="nv">used to say it.</span>

<span class="nv">I&#39;ve grown up into knowing it&#39;s simply silly to expect non-Christians to live</span>
<span class="nv">Biblically - I do not understand the judgement some Christians throw at</span>
<span class="nv">non-believers for things like cohabitation or getting drunk... It&#39;</span>s literally
what I would<span class="k"> do</span> without Jesus guiding my lie. However I&#39;ve always felt a pretty
unreasonable responsibility to point<span class="k"> out</span> where Christians are living<span class="k"> by</span> double
standards. Jesus addresses this with another commonly known question <span class="o">-</span> <span class="s">&quot;Why do</span>
you take the spec our of your brother&#39;s eye but ignore the<span class="k"> log in</span> your own
eye?<span class="s">&quot;. I&#39;m very personally aware, almost to a hyper degree, but I definitely</span>
don&#39;t have perfect<span class="o">-</span>awaremenss, and I don&#39;t know<span class="k"> if</span> I&#39;m losing zeal<span class="k"> as</span> I get
older or actually growing into wisdom but I am sliding<span class="k"> more</span> and<span class="k"> more</span> into a
position of just not worrying<span class="k"> about</span> what other people are doing. As long<span class="k"> as</span> my
family is safe I&#39;m basically a full<span class="o">-</span>blown libertarian when it comes to people
living their lives.

The BP message this morning was just great confirmation that this is
directionally correct, at least right now<span class="k"> for</span> me. I spent a lot of time<span class="k"> as</span> a
kid worrying<span class="k"> about</span> other Christians living appropriately (this was partly
driven<span class="k"> by</span> needing older Christians to<span class="k"> help</span> me live appropriately and<span class="k"> so</span> I felt
responsiblity to<span class="k"> help</span> provide that environment<span class="k"> for</span> myself... combination of
God&#39;s grace and undiagnosed AuDHD methinks). Now<span class="k"> as an</span> adult I spend most of my
time thanking Jesus<span class="k"> for</span> saving me from myself and I simply trust that<span class="k"> he</span> will
<span class="k">save</span> who<span class="k"> he</span> saves. Because that&#39;s not up to me I can focus<span class="k"> on</span> what I can manage
<span class="o">-</span> my own life and family.
