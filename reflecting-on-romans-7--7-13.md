  the law is sin? By no\nmeans! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have
  known sin. For I\nwould not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said,
  \u201CYou shall\nnot covet.\u201D 8 But sin, seizing an opportunity through the
  commandment, produced\nin me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law,
  sin lies dead. 9 I was\nonce alive apart from the law, but when the commandment
  came, sin came alive\nand I died. 10 The very commandment that promised life proved
  to be death to\nme. 11 For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment,
  deceived me and\nthrough it killed me. 12 So the law is holy, and the commandment
  is holy and\nrighteous and good. 13 Did that which is good, then, bring death to
  me? By no\nmeans! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order
  that\nsin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful\nbeyond
  measure. \n\n## Reflection\n\nAs I was dimwittedly working through 1 John 3 for\n[[olivet-mens-group-august-2025]]
  I found myself gravitating towards Romans 7\nand 8 as it brings clarity to John's
  words about practicing sin vs being a\nchild of God.\n\n???+ note \"Personal\"\n\n
  \   God's been good to me as I have started trying to be more focused in\n    theological
  study and reflection... It has been long enough for my \"break\" to\n    be over\n\nIt
  goes without saying in Christian circles that Romans is a tough cookie...\nPaul
  packs a lot in the letter and although I'm focusing right now on 7 verses,\nthe
  context certainly matters when it comes to deeper study. As for me this\nmorning
  I believe God's calling me to reverse-sear my conscience in regards to\nsome persistent
  sins in my life. I write a little note in my notes for the olivet study:\n\n> As
  I write this out, the Christian concept of \"setting the captives free\" and\njubilee
  and freedom strike my heart deeply. Just these phrases begin to call up\nemotions.
  But as I look at my life right now, what am I doing that shouts\nfreedom? I spend
  more time lately playing games than being entrenched in\ntheological study, I think
  about work more than things which are noble and\npraiseworthy, and I seem to purposefully
  focus on my own situations internally\nrather than on God's grace (which I do externally
  a lot - but I feel this\ntension inside - __a hook of doubt__)\n\nThese aren't the
  motifs in the passage, but the conversation around sin in our\nhearts spiderwebs
  throughout scripture very quickly if the conversation is to\nbe worth anything...
  Freedom is core in a Christian worldview, but am I free\nand devoted to Jesus or
  a morally bankrupt slave to myself?\n\nSo far I haven't even touched the passage
  so let me dive in a bit.\n\n???+ note \"\"\n\n    The rest of this post was dictated
  and transcribed via a STT utility I have at home. I often do this and rework my
  thoughts but here it's easier to word vomit the ideas and hope they make sense on
  the other side. I loosely edited it for readability but for whatever it's worth,
  this is moreso my thinking voice than my public speaking voice\n\n\"What then shall
  we say, that the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law I would
  not have known sin.\"\n\nAnd that feels to me a little bit like Paul saying what
  I've heard other Christians today say \u2014 something like:\n\"I didn't struggle
  with anger until I became a Christian and then it was a struggle!\"\n\nSo there's
  that side of it.\n\nAnd then the other side of it is that God has \"written eternity
  on our hearts,\" has He not? And through Common Grace, do we not all understand
  very common morality?\n\nAside from our worldviews, there are things that we know
  are wrong. Murdering is simply wrong. Another good example is something like cowardice\u2014or
  like Paul will go on to say, covetousness.\n\nWhether you're a Christian or not,
  you wouldn't value covetousness or cowardice. Cultures across the world and across
  history reject these things.\n\nSo, through becoming a Christian, the struggle with
  sin really begins \u2014 because it's the understanding not that something is just
  kind of morally wrong, but that you're violating the law of the Creator of the universe.\n\nNow,
  we don't want to dive in so deep that we reject the context (of Paul's thoughts
  in Romans 7:7\u201313). And so, I don't want to dissect these few verses too much.\n\nAnd
  so what's my reflection?\n\nI don't know.\n\nSin is crouching at the door.\nAnd
  it deceives me.\nSo, through the law, I learn what my sin is\u2014it lets me name
  my killer.\n\nThe law didn't bring death\u2014it brings understanding of death,
  because it reveals sin, which produces death.\n\nBut the part that I'm not \"to\"
  in my heart yet is the end of the passage. Verse 13:\n\n\"Did that which is good
  then (the law) bring death to me? By no means! It was sin producing death in me
  through what is good (the law), in order that sin might be shown to be sin and through
  the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.\"\n\nAnd I think that that phrase
  \"sinful beyond measure\" is a reflection of Paul's understanding of sin in his
  life.\n\nNow, I claim I have the same mental understanding...\n\nLater on in Romans
  7, Paul talks about his \"inner man\" and his mind being a slave to the law of the
  Spirit, but his body being a slave to sin.\n\nBut can I really say that my mind
  is a slave to the law of the Spirit?\n\nI certainly would make a lot of theological
  points about it\u2014but is it really?\n\nThat's my reflection this morning.\n\nI'm
  not as convicted over sin in my life, and so this reverse conscience searing needs
  to happen.\n\n---\n\n## Another Reflection\n\nAs I come back here for a second day,
  I believe by the guidance of the Spirit,\nI trust God to encourage and teach me
  through Paul's words\n\nHow do I know what is sin (lawlessness) and what is not
  sin (ie. not lawless, ie. _lawful_)? It's through the law as noted above. \n\nWhat
  to do about this though? One day since some conviction settled into my heart certainly
  doesn't indicate anything about my life, but what else is relevant to this meditation?\n\n!!!
  note \"Psalm 1:1-2\" \n\n    1 Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice
  of the wicked;  nor does he stand in the way of sinners;  nor does he sit in the
  assembly of mockers.  2\_Instead, in the law of Yahweh is his delight,  and on his
  law he meditates day and night.  \n\nThe \"law\" is _torah_... generally this is
  referring to a code of holy living.\nTorah isn't \"the law\" how we understand the
  law, it's case-law for holy living.\nTorah describes the flight of an arrow towards
  its target - it's the direction\nof your life. \n\nSo the psalmist says that it's
  in the constant meditation of God's law (God's direction for holy living) that a
  man is \"blessed\". \n\n> There's many words to use, but this word \"blessed\" is
  a Hebrew word used for when describing the good life of another person\n\n- Blessed
  is the man who meditates on the law of Yahweh\n- The law brings knowledge of sin\n-
  Furthermore, the law causes sin to \"become sinful beyond measure\"\n- How? Via
  the constant meditation of the law of Yahweh - which Psalm 1:3 says\n\n!!! note
  \"Psalm 1:3\" \n\n    3\_And so, he is like a tree planted by streams of water  that
  gives its fruit in its season;  its leaf also does not wither.  Therefore all that
  he does prospers.  \n\nBible stuff is apart of my daily vocabulary with anyone.
  God's law is in my\nmind, and hopefully my heart, every day. At the same time, the
  callousness is\npresent. It's Paul's lament about being the chief of sinners, and
  about the war\nin his members (Romans 7/8)... \n\nThe solution is this... day by
  day meditation - slightly more focused and\ndirected... God's blessing is absolutely
  on my lie - and the word for \"blessed\"\nin Psalm 1 referring to _others_ describing
  the life of the blessed man as\nblessed is very true for me - people around me know
  God's been good to me. So I\nhave every bit of faith that he will continue that
  goodness, and thankfully\nconviction this morning and week to take small steps towards
  a more devoted\nlife to the meditation of God's law.\n\n---\n\n## Round 3\n\nToday
  the Bible Project app brought me to Isaiah 61 which coincides with this\nextended
  reflection quite well as it's one of the places we get the image and\nphrase of
  \"setting the captives free\" which is a Biblical theme I see Paul\nleaning on at
  the end of Romans 7.\n\n!!! note \"Isaiah 61\"\n\n    1 The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh
  is upon me,\n    because Yahweh has anointed me,  he has sent me to bring good news
  to the\n    oppressed,  to bind up the brokenhearted,  to proclaim release to the
  captives\n    and liberation to those who are bound,  \n    2\_to proclaim the year
  of Yahweh\u2019s\n    favor,  and our God\u2019s day of vengeance,  to comfort all
  those in mourning,\n    3\_to give for those in mourning in Zion,  to give them
  a head wrap instead of\n    ashes,  the oil of joy instead of mourning,  a garment
  of praise instead of a\n    faint spirit.  And they will be called oaks of righteousness,
  \ the planting of\n    Yahweh, to show his glory.  \n\n    4\_And they shall build
  the ancient ruins,  they\n    shall erect the former deserted places.  And they
  shall restore the devastated\n    cities,  the deserted places of many generations.
  \ \n    5\_And strangers shall stand\n    and feed your flocks,  and foreigners
  shall be your farmers and vinedressers.\n    6\_But you shall be called the priests
  of Yahweh,  you will be called servers of\n    our God.  You shall eat the wealth
  of the nations,  and you shall boast in\n    their riches.  \n    7\_Instead of
  your shame, a double portion,  and instead of\n    insult, they will rejoice over
  their portion.  Therefore they will take a\n    double portion in their land;  they
  shall possess everlasting joy.  \n    8\_For I, Yahweh, love justice,  hate robbery
  and injustice,  and I will\n    faithfully give\n    their reward,  and I will make
  an everlasting covenant with them.  \n    9\_And their\n    descendants will be
  known among the nations,  and their offspring in the midst\n    of the peoples.
  \ All those who see them shall recognize them,  that they are\n    descendants whom
  Yahweh has blessed.  \n\n    10\_I will rejoice greatly in Yahweh;  my\n    being
  shall shout in exultation in my God.  For he has clothed me with garments\n    of
  salvation,  he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,  as a\n    bridegroom
  adorns himself with a head wrap like a priest,  and as a bride\n    adorns herself
  with her jewelry. \n    11\_For as the earth produces its sprout,  and\n    as a
  garden makes its plants sprout,  so the Lord Yahweh will make\n    righteousness
  sprout,  and praise before all the nations.  \n\n!!! warning \"\"\n\n    This isn't
  a reflection or study of Isaiah 61 - just a few notes as they pertain to my reflection
  on Romans 7 and 8 and the posture I have towards sin in my life\n\nThis is a messianic
  prophecy delivered to the people of God in captivity to\nspur the remnant of the
  faithful to continue hoping in the promises of Yahweh.\n\nIsrael was in captivity
  more or less as discipline for violating God's word\npretty regularly... Consistent
  with my reflection so far - has \"sin become sin\nbeyond measure\" to me yet? No,
  just as it wasn't for Israel, and God allowed\nHis people to be enslaved multiple
  times as they turned to foreign gods... is\ncallousness to sin any different than
  turning to a foreign god? No, it's\nexactly what it is.\n\nBut thankfully the over-arching
  story is about Yahweh's faithfulness to His\npeople, and this prophecy is for those
  who exercise faithfulness to Yahweh....\nthat's the crux of my reflection on Romans
  7, how can I claim the promises of\nGod if sin is so present in my life? I think
  the answer is that it's only\nthrough the awakening of the Spirit that I can genuinely
  question my loyalty to\nYahweh and also acknowledge his loyalty to the Promise He
  brought me into. By\nGod's grace I'm just a guy who the Lord has grace on, and I
  pray through daily\nmeditation my will becomes so conformed to the will of Jesus
  that I can\nfaithfully say \"sin has become beyond sin to me\"\n\nPraise God for
  Paul's words at the end of Romans 7\n\n!!! note \"Romans 7:24-25\"\n\n    24 Wretched
  man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God
  through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind,
  but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.\n\n---\n\n## Round 4\n\n!!! note \"Romans
  7:13\"\n\n    13 Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It
  was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be
  shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.
  \n\nThis morning I don't know if it was another translation or the direct explicit\nwork
  of the Spirit but I feel like something clicked just a little bit here.\nThe law
  didn't bring sin (lawlessness), God's law pre-exists Torah (Genesis,\nthe trees),
  so the law says what is good and bad, and it's the brokenness of\nhumanity (sin)
  producing death in us/me and the production of death shows sin\nto be what it is
  - sinful beyond measure\n\nSo as I reflect here on Paul, Romans, and myself - what
  am I missing or what is\nGod recovering in me? This week has been pretty good concerning
  the areas of my\nmind and life where I feel callous and hardened. The daily meditation
  can't NOT\nbe the reason - devotion in the morning, however minimal and before anything
  else,\nis producing in me the will to do God's good work in my own life. I don't
  mean\ngiving money and doing charity - but in the privacy of my mind and day, do
  I\nhonor the Lord with every thought?\n\nThe cliche but honest answer is no but
  I feel God's working in my heart, the\ntug towards Heaven and away from the hellish
  pit of my own desires\n\n---\n\n## Round 5\n\nVerse 8b \"For apart from the law,
  sin lies dead.\"\n\n> This reflection was done audibly and the transcription was
  modified slightly for this post\n\nI think there's quite a few interesting perspectives,
  maybe two that come to mind pretty quickly.\n\nFor context, the rest of the verse
  is \n\n!!! note \"Romanas 7:8\"\n\n    but sin seizing an opportunity through the
  commandment produced in me all kinds of covetousness, for apart from the law, sin
  lies dead.\n\nSo the first observation is sin gets its life and its effect (effectual
  power) through the conduit of the law.\nAnd so the law says don't do X. That means
  we now have knowledge to not do X. \n\nAnd then it's like the existence of sin has
  to be presupposed because it's the very same sin as in Genesis three.\nGod's rule
  of the land said not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, and sin
  seizing the opportunity through that commandment produced in Eve all kinds of covetousness.\n\nBut
  it wasn't really __actually__ the command of God.\nIt was the snake.\nSo in that
  sense, depending on our interpretation of Genesis 3, which I will forego...\nThe
  snake is the embodiment of sin, and so we're not so concerned with the ontological
  origins of sin, but rather with processing its effect and consequences in our daily
  life.\nAnd so that first perspective is to say that - for me, by God's grace, I
  know the law.\nIt means that by God's grace, sin has the opportunity to produce
  __things__ in me, and in that same breath of grace -\nJesus saves me.\nThat's the
  end of chapter seven.\n\n!!! note \"Romans 7:24-25\"\n\n    24 Wretched man that
  I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God through Jesus
  Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my
  flesh I serve the law of sin.\n\nThe other perspective that I have on this right
  now is not inward looking, and so I don't want to harp on it and meditate much on
  other people.\nBut Christians certainly have internal (internal to the community
  of faith) conversations about the morality of non-Christians and what should be
  expected of non-believers.\nAs far as a moral life is concerned and there's various
  theological opinions and various worldviews, even within Christianity through which
  we can filter reality and people's actions and their moralities.\nAnd so in that
  vein, perhaps something I see here is to read it almost backwards (transposed is
  a better word), \n\n> sin lies dead apart from the law.\n\nAnd you think, I think,
  about our culture's hedonistic posture towards being a slave to our own desires.\nAmerican
  culture largely celebrates, or Western culture rather, largely celebrates the individual
  decision to do what the individual wants.\nAnd we live in a culture where to shame
  others is itself shamed.\nIt is unacceptable to call people to higher standards
  of living.\nBut why should we (Christians) be surprised and why is this news and
  why do Christians spend time talking about it?\nI think Paul gives us the answer.\n\"Apart
  from the law\" (and the law is the direction in which we strive for holiness)\nAnd
  so \"apart from that, sin lies dead\" meaning sin doesn't seize an opportunity through
  any commandment.\nBecause apart from the law sin can't be shown to be sinfulness.\nThat's
  verse 13.\n\n!!! note \"Romans 7:13\"\n\n    13 Did that which is good, then, bring
  death to me? By no\n    means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is
  good, in order that\n    sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment
  might become sinful\n    beyond measure.\n\nSo that last thought, it isn't so much
  that non-believers don't have the knowledge of good and bad.\nThe Bible says that
  God has written eternity on our hearts.\nAnd we have moral discussions in the public
  square all the time, so people\ncertainly are aware of opinions about morality,
  and it is in the rebellion\nagainst the good and moral positions where I'm right
  now actually finding\nsecurity in **my** position as a __chosen child of God__ because
  honestly, I love debauchery, but (thankfully)\npart of me hates it, and it's that
  part of me that hates it, that is the Spirit\nin me, that is the grace of the Lord
  Jesus, saving me from this body of sin and death."

    (ESV): 7 What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no\nmeans! Yet if it
    had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I\nwould not have known
    what it is to covet if the law had not said, \u201CYou shall\nnot covet.\u201D
    8 But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced\nin me all
    kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin lies dead. 9 I was\nonce alive
    apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive\nand I died.
    10 The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to\nme. 11 For sin,
    seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and\nthrough it killed
    me. 12 So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and\nrighteous and good.
    13 Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no\nmeans! It was sin,
    producing death in me through what is good, in order that\nsin might be shown
    to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful\nbeyond measure.</p>\n<h2

    working through 1 John 3 for\n<a class=\"wikilink\" href=\"/olivet-mens-group-august-2025\">olivet-mens-group-august-2025</a>
    I found myself gravitating towards Romans 7\nand 8 as it brings clarity to John's
    words about practicing sin vs being a\nchild of God.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition
    note is-collapsible collapsible-open\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Personal</p>\n<p>God's
    been good to me as I have started trying to be more focused in\ntheological study
    and reflection... It has been long enough for my &quot;break&quot; to\nbe over</p>\n</div>\n<p>It
    goes without saying in Christian circles that Romans is a tough cookie...\nPaul
    packs a lot in the letter and although I'm focusing right now on 7 verses,\nthe
    context certainly matters when it comes to deeper study. As for me this\nmorning
    I believe God's calling me to reverse-sear my conscience in regards to\nsome persistent
    sins in my life. I write a little note in my notes for the olivet study:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As
    I write this out, the Christian concept of &quot;setting the captives free&quot;
    and\njubilee and freedom strike my heart deeply. Just these phrases begin to call
    up\nemotions. But as I look at my life right now, what am I doing that shouts\nfreedom?
    I spend more time lately playing games than being entrenched in\ntheological study,
    I think about work more than things which are noble and\npraiseworthy, and I seem
    to purposefully focus on my own situations internally\nrather than on God's grace
    (which I do externally a lot - but I feel this\ntension inside - <strong>a hook
    of doubt</strong>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These aren't the motifs in the passage,
    but the conversation around sin in our\nhearts spiderwebs throughout scripture
    very quickly if the conversation is to\nbe worth anything... Freedom is core in
    a Christian worldview, but am I free\nand devoted to Jesus or a morally bankrupt
    slave to myself?</p>\n<p>So far I haven't even touched the passage so let me dive
    in a bit.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note is-collapsible collapsible-open\">\n<p>The
    rest of this post was dictated and transcribed via a STT utility I have at home.
    I often do this and rework my thoughts but here it's easier to word vomit the
    ideas and hope they make sense on the other side. I loosely edited it for readability
    but for whatever it's worth, this is moreso my thinking voice than my public speaking
    voice</p>\n</div>\n<p>&quot;What then shall we say, that the law is sin? By no
    means! Yet if it had not been for the law I would not have known sin.&quot;</p>\n<p>And
    that feels to me a little bit like Paul saying what I've heard other Christians
    today say \u2014 something like:\n&quot;I didn't struggle with anger until I became
    a Christian and then it was a struggle!&quot;</p>\n<p>So there's that side of
    it.</p>\n<p>And then the other side of it is that God has &quot;written eternity
    on our hearts,&quot; has He not? And through Common Grace, do we not all understand
    very common morality?</p>\n<p>Aside from our worldviews, there are things that
    we know are wrong. Murdering is simply wrong. Another good example is something
    like cowardice\u2014or like Paul will go on to say, covetousness.</p>\n<p>Whether
    you're a Christian or not, you wouldn't value covetousness or cowardice. Cultures
    across the world and across history reject these things.</p>\n<p>So, through becoming
    a Christian, the struggle with sin really begins \u2014 because it's the understanding
    not that something is just kind of morally wrong, but that you're violating the
    law of the Creator of the universe.</p>\n<p>Now, we don't want to dive in so deep
    that we reject the context (of Paul's thoughts in Romans 7:7\u201313). And so,
    I don't want to dissect these few verses too much.</p>\n<p>And so what's my reflection?</p>\n<p>I
    don't know.</p>\n<p>Sin is crouching at the door.\nAnd it deceives me.\nSo, through
    the law, I learn what my sin is\u2014it lets me name my killer.</p>\n<p>The law
    didn't bring death\u2014it brings understanding of death, because it reveals sin,
    which produces death.</p>\n<p>But the part that I'm not &quot;to&quot; in my heart
    yet is the end of the passage. Verse 13:</p>\n<p>&quot;Did that which is good

    for a second day, I believe by the guidance of the Spirit,\nI trust God to encourage
    and teach me through Paul's words</p>\n<p>How do I know what is sin (lawlessness)
    and what is not sin (ie. not lawless, ie. <em>lawful</em>)? It's through the law
    as noted above.</p>\n<p>What to do about this though? One day since some conviction
    settled into my heart certainly doesn't indicate anything about my life, but what
    else is relevant to this meditation?</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Psalm 1:1-2</p>\n<p>1 Blessed is the man who does not
    walk in the advice of the wicked;  nor does he stand in the way of sinners;  nor
    does he sit in the assembly of mockers.  2\_Instead, in the law of Yahweh is his
    delight,  and on his law he meditates day and night.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The &quot;law&quot;
    is <em>torah</em>... generally this is referring to a code of holy living.\nTorah
    isn't &quot;the law&quot; how we understand the law, it's case-law for holy living.\nTorah
    describes the flight of an arrow towards its target - it's the direction\nof your
    life.</p>\n<p>So the psalmist says that it's in the constant meditation of God's
    law (God's direction for holy living) that a man is &quot;blessed&quot;.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There's
    many words to use, but this word &quot;blessed&quot; is a Hebrew word used for
    when describing the good life of another person</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Blessed
    is the man who meditates on the law of Yahweh</li>\n<li>The law brings knowledge
    of sin</li>\n<li>Furthermore, the law causes sin to &quot;become sinful beyond
    measure&quot;</li>\n<li>How? Via the constant meditation of the law of Yahweh
    - which Psalm 1:3 says</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Psalm
    1:3</p>\n<p>3\_And so, he is like a tree planted by streams of water  that gives
    its fruit in its season;  its leaf also does not wither.  Therefore all that he
    does prospers.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Bible stuff is apart of my daily vocabulary with
    anyone. God's law is in my\nmind, and hopefully my heart, every day. At the same
    time, the callousness is\npresent. It's Paul's lament about being the chief of
    sinners, and about the war\nin his members (Romans 7/8)...</p>\n<p>The solution
    is this... day by day meditation - slightly more focused and\ndirected... God's
    blessing is absolutely on my lie - and the word for &quot;blessed&quot;\nin Psalm
    1 referring to <em>others</em> describing the life of the blessed man as\nblessed
    is very true for me - people around me know God's been good to me. So I\nhave
    every bit of faith that he will continue that goodness, and thankfully\nconviction
    this morning and week to take small steps towards a more devoted\nlife to the
    meditation of God's law.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"round-3\">Round 3 <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    well as it's one of the places we get the image and\nphrase of &quot;setting the

    of Romans 7.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Isaiah

    in Zion,  to give them a head wrap instead of\nashes,  the oil of joy instead
    of mourning,  a garment of praise instead of a\nfaint spirit.  And they will be
    called oaks of righteousness,  the planting of\nYahweh, to show his glory.</p>\n<p>4\_And
    they shall build the ancient ruins,  they\nshall erect the former deserted places.
    \ And they shall restore the devastated\ncities,  the deserted places of many
    generations.<br />\n5\_And strangers shall stand\nand feed your flocks,  and foreigners

    shame, a double portion,  and instead of\ninsult, they will rejoice over their
    portion.  Therefore they will take a\ndouble portion in their land;  they shall

    and injustice,  and I will\nfaithfully give\ntheir reward,  and I will make an
    everlasting covenant with them.<br />\n9\_And their\ndescendants will be known
    among the nations,  and their offspring in the midst\nof the peoples.  All those
    who see them shall recognize them,  that they are\ndescendants whom Yahweh has

    in exultation in my God.  For he has clothed me with garments\nof salvation,  he
    has covered me with the robe of righteousness,  as a\nbridegroom adorns himself
    with a head wrap like a priest,  and as a bride\nadorns herself with her jewelry.\n11\_For
    as the earth produces its sprout,  and\nas a garden makes its plants sprout,  so

    class=\"admonition warning\">\n<p>This isn't a reflection or study of Isaiah 61
    - just a few notes as they pertain to my reflection on Romans 7 and 8 and the
    posture I have towards sin in my life</p>\n</div>\n<p>This is a messianic prophecy
    delivered to the people of God in captivity to\nspur the remnant of the faithful
    to continue hoping in the promises of Yahweh.</p>\n<p>Israel was in captivity
    more or less as discipline for violating God's word\npretty regularly... Consistent
    with my reflection so far - has &quot;sin become sin\nbeyond measure&quot; to
    me yet? No, just as it wasn't for Israel, and God allowed\nHis people to be enslaved
    multiple times as they turned to foreign gods... is\ncallousness to sin any different
    than turning to a foreign god? No, it's\nexactly what it is.</p>\n<p>But thankfully
    the over-arching story is about Yahweh's faithfulness to His\npeople, and this
    prophecy is for those who exercise faithfulness to Yahweh....\nthat's the crux
    of my reflection on Romans 7, how can I claim the promises of\nGod if sin is so
    present in my life? I think the answer is that it's only\nthrough the awakening
    of the Spirit that I can genuinely question my loyalty to\nYahweh and also acknowledge
    his loyalty to the Promise He brought me into. By\nGod's grace I'm just a guy
    who the Lord has grace on, and I pray through daily\nmeditation my will becomes
    so conformed to the will of Jesus that I can\nfaithfully say &quot;sin has become
    beyond sin to me&quot;</p>\n<p>Praise God for Paul's words at the end of Romans
    7</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Romans 7:24-25</p>\n<p>24

    I don't know if it was another translation or the direct explicit\nwork of the

    bring sin (lawlessness), God's law pre-exists Torah (Genesis,\nthe trees), so
    the law says what is good and bad, and it's the brokenness of\nhumanity (sin)
    producing death in us/me and the production of death shows sin\nto be what it
    is - sinful beyond measure</p>\n<p>So as I reflect here on Paul, Romans, and myself
    - what am I missing or what is\nGod recovering in me? This week has been pretty
    good concerning the areas of my\nmind and life where I feel callous and hardened.
    The daily meditation can't NOT\nbe the reason - devotion in the morning, however
    minimal and before anything else,\nis producing in me the will to do God's good

    from the law, sin lies dead.&quot;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This reflection was done
    audibly and the transcription was modified slightly for this post</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I
    think there's quite a few interesting perspectives, maybe two that come to mind
    pretty quickly.</p>\n<p>For context, the rest of the verse is</p>\n<div class=\"admonition
    note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Romanas 7:8</p>\n<p>but sin seizing an
    opportunity through the commandment produced in me all kinds of covetousness,
    for apart from the law, sin lies dead.</p>\n</div>\n<p>So the first observation
    is sin gets its life and its effect (effectual power) through the conduit of the
    law.\nAnd so the law says don't do X. That means we now have knowledge to not
    do X.</p>\n<p>And then it's like the existence of sin has to be presupposed because
    it's the very same sin as in Genesis three.\nGod's rule of the land said not to
    eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, and sin seizing the opportunity
    through that commandment produced in Eve all kinds of covetousness.</p>\n<p>But
    it wasn't really <strong>actually</strong> the command of God.\nIt was the snake.\nSo
    in that sense, depending on our interpretation of Genesis 3, which I will forego...\nThe
    snake is the embodiment of sin, and so we're not so concerned with the ontological
    origins of sin, but rather with processing its effect and consequences in our
    daily life.\nAnd so that first perspective is to say that - for me, by God's grace,
    I know the law.\nIt means that by God's grace, sin has the opportunity to produce
    <strong>things</strong> in me, and in that same breath of grace -\nJesus saves
    me.\nThat's the end of chapter seven.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Romans 7:24-25</p>\n<p>24 Wretched man that I am! Who
    will deliver me from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ
    our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh
    I serve the law of sin.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The other perspective that I have on this
    right now is not inward looking, and so I don't want to harp on it and meditate
    much on other people.\nBut Christians certainly have internal (internal to the
    community of faith) conversations about the morality of non-Christians and what
    should be expected of non-believers.\nAs far as a moral life is concerned and
    there's various theological opinions and various worldviews, even within Christianity
    through which we can filter reality and people's actions and their moralities.\nAnd
    so in that vein, perhaps something I see here is to read it almost backwards (transposed
    is a better word),</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>sin lies dead apart from the law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And
    you think, I think, about our culture's hedonistic posture towards being a slave
    to our own desires.\nAmerican culture largely celebrates, or Western culture rather,
    largely celebrates the individual decision to do what the individual wants.\nAnd
    we live in a culture where to shame others is itself shamed.\nIt is unacceptable
    to call people to higher standards of living.\nBut why should we (Christians)
    be surprised and why is this news and why do Christians spend time talking about
    it?\nI think Paul gives us the answer.\n&quot;Apart from the law&quot; (and the
    law is the direction in which we strive for holiness)\nAnd so &quot;apart from
    that, sin lies dead&quot; meaning sin doesn't seize an opportunity through any
    commandment.\nBecause apart from the law sin can't be shown to be sinfulness.\nThat's
    verse 13.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Romans
    7:13</p>\n<p>13 Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no\nmeans!
    It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that\nsin might
    be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful\nbeyond measure.</p>\n</div>\n<p>So
    that last thought, it isn't so much that non-believers don't have the knowledge
    of good and bad.\nThe Bible says that God has written eternity on our hearts.\nAnd
    we have moral discussions in the public square all the time, so people\ncertainly
    are aware of opinions about morality, and it is in the rebellion\nagainst the
    good and moral positions where I'm right now actually finding\nsecurity in <strong>my</strong>
    position as a <strong>chosen child of God</strong> because honestly, I love debauchery,
    but (thankfully)\npart of me hates it, and it's that part of me that hates it,
    that is the Spirit\nin me, that is the grace of the Lord Jesus, saving me from
    this body of sin and death.</p>\n\n        </section>\n    </article>\n</section>

    had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I\nwould not have known
    what it is to covet if the law had not said, \u201CYou shall\nnot covet.\u201D

    apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive\nand I died.
    10 The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to\nme. 11 For sin,
    seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and\nthrough it killed
    me. 12 So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and\nrighteous and good.
    13 Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no\nmeans! It was sin,
    producing death in me through what is good, in order that\nsin might be shown
    to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful\nbeyond measure.</p>\n<h2

    working through 1 John 3 for\n<a class=\"wikilink\" href=\"/olivet-mens-group-august-2025\">olivet-mens-group-august-2025</a>
    I found myself gravitating towards Romans 7\nand 8 as it brings clarity to John's
    words about practicing sin vs being a\nchild of God.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition
    note is-collapsible collapsible-open\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Personal</p>\n<p>God's
    been good to me as I have started trying to be more focused in\ntheological study
    and reflection... It has been long enough for my &quot;break&quot; to\nbe over</p>\n</div>\n<p>It
    goes without saying in Christian circles that Romans is a tough cookie...\nPaul
    packs a lot in the letter and although I'm focusing right now on 7 verses,\nthe
    context certainly matters when it comes to deeper study. As for me this\nmorning
    I believe God's calling me to reverse-sear my conscience in regards to\nsome persistent
    sins in my life. I write a little note in my notes for the olivet study:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As
    I write this out, the Christian concept of &quot;setting the captives free&quot;
    and\njubilee and freedom strike my heart deeply. Just these phrases begin to call
    up\nemotions. But as I look at my life right now, what am I doing that shouts\nfreedom?
    I spend more time lately playing games than being entrenched in\ntheological study,
    I think about work more than things which are noble and\npraiseworthy, and I seem
    to purposefully focus on my own situations internally\nrather than on God's grace
    (which I do externally a lot - but I feel this\ntension inside - <strong>a hook
    of doubt</strong>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These aren't the motifs in the passage,
    but the conversation around sin in our\nhearts spiderwebs throughout scripture
    very quickly if the conversation is to\nbe worth anything... Freedom is core in
    a Christian worldview, but am I free\nand devoted to Jesus or a morally bankrupt
    slave to myself?</p>\n<p>So far I haven't even touched the passage so let me dive
    in a bit.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note is-collapsible collapsible-open\">\n<p>The
    rest of this post was dictated and transcribed via a STT utility I have at home.
    I often do this and rework my thoughts but here it's easier to word vomit the
    ideas and hope they make sense on the other side. I loosely edited it for readability
    but for whatever it's worth, this is moreso my thinking voice than my public speaking
    voice</p>\n</div>\n<p>&quot;What then shall we say, that the law is sin? By no
    means! Yet if it had not been for the law I would not have known sin.&quot;</p>\n<p>And
    that feels to me a little bit like Paul saying what I've heard other Christians
    today say \u2014 something like:\n&quot;I didn't struggle with anger until I became
    a Christian and then it was a struggle!&quot;</p>\n<p>So there's that side of
    it.</p>\n<p>And then the other side of it is that God has &quot;written eternity
    on our hearts,&quot; has He not? And through Common Grace, do we not all understand
    very common morality?</p>\n<p>Aside from our worldviews, there are things that
    we know are wrong. Murdering is simply wrong. Another good example is something
    like cowardice\u2014or like Paul will go on to say, covetousness.</p>\n<p>Whether
    you're a Christian or not, you wouldn't value covetousness or cowardice. Cultures
    across the world and across history reject these things.</p>\n<p>So, through becoming
    a Christian, the struggle with sin really begins \u2014 because it's the understanding
    not that something is just kind of morally wrong, but that you're violating the
    law of the Creator of the universe.</p>\n<p>Now, we don't want to dive in so deep
    that we reject the context (of Paul's thoughts in Romans 7:7\u201313). And so,
    I don't want to dissect these few verses too much.</p>\n<p>And so what's my reflection?</p>\n<p>I
    don't know.</p>\n<p>Sin is crouching at the door.\nAnd it deceives me.\nSo, through
    the law, I learn what my sin is\u2014it lets me name my killer.</p>\n<p>The law
    didn't bring death\u2014it brings understanding of death, because it reveals sin,
    which produces death.</p>\n<p>But the part that I'm not &quot;to&quot; in my heart
    yet is the end of the passage. Verse 13:</p>\n<p>&quot;Did that which is good
    then (the law) bring death to me? By no means! It was sin producing death in me
    through what is good (the law), in order that sin might be shown to be sin and
    through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.&quot;</p>\n<p>And
    I think that that phrase &quot;sinful beyond measure&quot; is a reflection of
    Paul's understanding of sin in his life.</p>\n<p>Now, I claim I have the same
    mental understanding...</p>\n<p>Later on in Romans 7, Paul talks about his &quot;inner
    man&quot; and his mind being a slave to the law of the Spirit, but his body being
    a slave to sin.</p>\n<p>But can I really say that my mind is a slave to the law
    of the Spirit?</p>\n<p>I certainly would make a lot of theological points about
    it\u2014but is it really?</p>\n<p>That's my reflection this morning.</p>\n<p>I'm
    not as convicted over sin in my life, and so this reverse conscience searing needs
    to happen.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"another-reflection\">Another Reflection <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    for a second day, I believe by the guidance of the Spirit,\nI trust God to encourage
    and teach me through Paul's words</p>\n<p>How do I know what is sin (lawlessness)
    and what is not sin (ie. not lawless, ie. <em>lawful</em>)? It's through the law
    as noted above.</p>\n<p>What to do about this though? One day since some conviction
    settled into my heart certainly doesn't indicate anything about my life, but what
    else is relevant to this meditation?</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Psalm 1:1-2</p>\n<p>1 Blessed is the man who does not
    walk in the advice of the wicked;  nor does he stand in the way of sinners;  nor
    does he sit in the assembly of mockers.  2\_Instead, in the law of Yahweh is his
    delight,  and on his law he meditates day and night.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The &quot;law&quot;
    is <em>torah</em>... generally this is referring to a code of holy living.\nTorah
    isn't &quot;the law&quot; how we understand the law, it's case-law for holy living.\nTorah
    describes the flight of an arrow towards its target - it's the direction\nof your
    life.</p>\n<p>So the psalmist says that it's in the constant meditation of God's
    law (God's direction for holy living) that a man is &quot;blessed&quot;.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There's
    many words to use, but this word &quot;blessed&quot; is a Hebrew word used for
    when describing the good life of another person</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Blessed
    is the man who meditates on the law of Yahweh</li>\n<li>The law brings knowledge
    of sin</li>\n<li>Furthermore, the law causes sin to &quot;become sinful beyond
    measure&quot;</li>\n<li>How? Via the constant meditation of the law of Yahweh
    - which Psalm 1:3 says</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Psalm
    1:3</p>\n<p>3\_And so, he is like a tree planted by streams of water  that gives
    its fruit in its season;  its leaf also does not wither.  Therefore all that he
    does prospers.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Bible stuff is apart of my daily vocabulary with
    anyone. God's law is in my\nmind, and hopefully my heart, every day. At the same
    time, the callousness is\npresent. It's Paul's lament about being the chief of
    sinners, and about the war\nin his members (Romans 7/8)...</p>\n<p>The solution
    is this... day by day meditation - slightly more focused and\ndirected... God's
    blessing is absolutely on my lie - and the word for &quot;blessed&quot;\nin Psalm
    1 referring to <em>others</em> describing the life of the blessed man as\nblessed
    is very true for me - people around me know God's been good to me. So I\nhave
    every bit of faith that he will continue that goodness, and thankfully\nconviction
    this morning and week to take small steps towards a more devoted\nlife to the
    meditation of God's law.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"round-3\">Round 3 <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    of mourning,  a garment of praise instead of a\nfaint spirit.  And they will be
    called oaks of righteousness,  the planting of\nYahweh, to show his glory.</p>\n<p>4\_And
    they shall build the ancient ruins,  they\nshall erect the former deserted places.

    class=\"admonition warning\">\n<p>This isn't a reflection or study of Isaiah 61
    - just a few notes as they pertain to my reflection on Romans 7 and 8 and the
    posture I have towards sin in my life</p>\n</div>\n<p>This is a messianic prophecy
    delivered to the people of God in captivity to\nspur the remnant of the faithful
    to continue hoping in the promises of Yahweh.</p>\n<p>Israel was in captivity
    more or less as discipline for violating God's word\npretty regularly... Consistent
    with my reflection so far - has &quot;sin become sin\nbeyond measure&quot; to
    me yet? No, just as it wasn't for Israel, and God allowed\nHis people to be enslaved
    multiple times as they turned to foreign gods... is\ncallousness to sin any different
    than turning to a foreign god? No, it's\nexactly what it is.</p>\n<p>But thankfully
    the over-arching story is about Yahweh's faithfulness to His\npeople, and this
    prophecy is for those who exercise faithfulness to Yahweh....\nthat's the crux
    of my reflection on Romans 7, how can I claim the promises of\nGod if sin is so
    present in my life? I think the answer is that it's only\nthrough the awakening
    of the Spirit that I can genuinely question my loyalty to\nYahweh and also acknowledge
    his loyalty to the Promise He brought me into. By\nGod's grace I'm just a guy
    who the Lord has grace on, and I pray through daily\nmeditation my will becomes
    so conformed to the will of Jesus that I can\nfaithfully say &quot;sin has become
    beyond sin to me&quot;</p>\n<p>Praise God for Paul's words at the end of Romans

    I don't know if it was another translation or the direct explicit\nwork of the
    Spirit but I feel like something clicked just a little bit here.\nThe law didn't
    bring sin (lawlessness), God's law pre-exists Torah (Genesis,\nthe trees), so
    the law says what is good and bad, and it's the brokenness of\nhumanity (sin)
    producing death in us/me and the production of death shows sin\nto be what it
    is - sinful beyond measure</p>\n<p>So as I reflect here on Paul, Romans, and myself
    - what am I missing or what is\nGod recovering in me? This week has been pretty
    good concerning the areas of my\nmind and life where I feel callous and hardened.
    The daily meditation can't NOT\nbe the reason - devotion in the morning, however
    minimal and before anything else,\nis producing in me the will to do God's good
    work in my own life. I don't mean\ngiving money and doing charity - but in the
    privacy of my mind and day, do I\nhonor the Lord with every thought?</p>\n<p>The

    from the law, sin lies dead.&quot;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This reflection was done
    audibly and the transcription was modified slightly for this post</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I
    think there's quite a few interesting perspectives, maybe two that come to mind
    pretty quickly.</p>\n<p>For context, the rest of the verse is</p>\n<div class=\"admonition
    note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Romanas 7:8</p>\n<p>but sin seizing an
    opportunity through the commandment produced in me all kinds of covetousness,
    for apart from the law, sin lies dead.</p>\n</div>\n<p>So the first observation
    is sin gets its life and its effect (effectual power) through the conduit of the
    law.\nAnd so the law says don't do X. That means we now have knowledge to not
    do X.</p>\n<p>And then it's like the existence of sin has to be presupposed because
    it's the very same sin as in Genesis three.\nGod's rule of the land said not to
    eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, and sin seizing the opportunity
    through that commandment produced in Eve all kinds of covetousness.</p>\n<p>But
    it wasn't really <strong>actually</strong> the command of God.\nIt was the snake.\nSo
    in that sense, depending on our interpretation of Genesis 3, which I will forego...\nThe
    snake is the embodiment of sin, and so we're not so concerned with the ontological
    origins of sin, but rather with processing its effect and consequences in our
    daily life.\nAnd so that first perspective is to say that - for me, by God's grace,
    I know the law.\nIt means that by God's grace, sin has the opportunity to produce
    <strong>things</strong> in me, and in that same breath of grace -\nJesus saves
    me.\nThat's the end of chapter seven.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Romans 7:24-25</p>\n<p>24 Wretched man that I am! Who
    will deliver me from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ
    our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh
    I serve the law of sin.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The other perspective that I have on this
    right now is not inward looking, and so I don't want to harp on it and meditate
    much on other people.\nBut Christians certainly have internal (internal to the
    community of faith) conversations about the morality of non-Christians and what
    should be expected of non-believers.\nAs far as a moral life is concerned and
    there's various theological opinions and various worldviews, even within Christianity
    through which we can filter reality and people's actions and their moralities.\nAnd
    so in that vein, perhaps something I see here is to read it almost backwards (transposed
    is a better word),</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>sin lies dead apart from the law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And
    you think, I think, about our culture's hedonistic posture towards being a slave
    to our own desires.\nAmerican culture largely celebrates, or Western culture rather,
    largely celebrates the individual decision to do what the individual wants.\nAnd
    we live in a culture where to shame others is itself shamed.\nIt is unacceptable
    to call people to higher standards of living.\nBut why should we (Christians)
    be surprised and why is this news and why do Christians spend time talking about
    it?\nI think Paul gives us the answer.\n&quot;Apart from the law&quot; (and the
    law is the direction in which we strive for holiness)\nAnd so &quot;apart from
    that, sin lies dead&quot; meaning sin doesn't seize an opportunity through any
    commandment.\nBecause apart from the law sin can't be shown to be sinfulness.\nThat's
    verse 13.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Romans
    7:13</p>\n<p>13 Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no\nmeans!

    be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful\nbeyond measure.</p>\n</div>\n<p>So
    that last thought, it isn't so much that non-believers don't have the knowledge
    of good and bad.\nThe Bible says that God has written eternity on our hearts.\nAnd
    we have moral discussions in the public square all the time, so people\ncertainly
    are aware of opinions about morality, and it is in the rebellion\nagainst the
    good and moral positions where I'm right now actually finding\nsecurity in <strong>my</strong>
    position as a <strong>chosen child of God</strong> because honestly, I love debauchery,
    but (thankfully)\npart of me hates it, and it's that part of me that hates it,
    that is the Spirit\nin me, that is the grace of the Lord Jesus, saving me from
    this body of sin and death.</p>\n\n        </section>\n    </article>\n</section>"

    (ESV): 7 What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no\nmeans! Yet if it
    had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I\nwould not have known
    what it is to covet if the law had not said, \u201CYou shall\nnot covet.\u201D
    8 But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced\nin me all
    kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin lies dead. 9 I was\nonce alive
    apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive\nand I died.
    10 The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to\nme. 11 For sin,
    seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and\nthrough it killed
    me. 12 So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and\nrighteous and good.
    13 Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no\nmeans! It was sin,
    producing death in me through what is good, in order that\nsin might be shown
    to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful\nbeyond measure.</p>\n<h2

    working through 1 John 3 for\n<a class=\"wikilink\" href=\"/olivet-mens-group-august-2025\">olivet-mens-group-august-2025</a>
    I found myself gravitating towards Romans 7\nand 8 as it brings clarity to John's
    words about practicing sin vs being a\nchild of God.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition
    note is-collapsible collapsible-open\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Personal</p>\n<p>God's
    been good to me as I have started trying to be more focused in\ntheological study
    and reflection... It has been long enough for my &quot;break&quot; to\nbe over</p>\n</div>\n<p>It
    goes without saying in Christian circles that Romans is a tough cookie...\nPaul
    packs a lot in the letter and although I'm focusing right now on 7 verses,\nthe
    context certainly matters when it comes to deeper study. As for me this\nmorning
    I believe God's calling me to reverse-sear my conscience in regards to\nsome persistent
    sins in my life. I write a little note in my notes for the olivet study:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As
    I write this out, the Christian concept of &quot;setting the captives free&quot;
    and\njubilee and freedom strike my heart deeply. Just these phrases begin to call
    up\nemotions. But as I look at my life right now, what am I doing that shouts\nfreedom?
    I spend more time lately playing games than being entrenched in\ntheological study,
    I think about work more than things which are noble and\npraiseworthy, and I seem
    to purposefully focus on my own situations internally\nrather than on God's grace
    (which I do externally a lot - but I feel this\ntension inside - <strong>a hook
    of doubt</strong>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These aren't the motifs in the passage,
    but the conversation around sin in our\nhearts spiderwebs throughout scripture
    very quickly if the conversation is to\nbe worth anything... Freedom is core in
    a Christian worldview, but am I free\nand devoted to Jesus or a morally bankrupt
    slave to myself?</p>\n<p>So far I haven't even touched the passage so let me dive
    in a bit.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note is-collapsible collapsible-open\">\n<p>The
    rest of this post was dictated and transcribed via a STT utility I have at home.
    I often do this and rework my thoughts but here it's easier to word vomit the
    ideas and hope they make sense on the other side. I loosely edited it for readability
    but for whatever it's worth, this is moreso my thinking voice than my public speaking
    voice</p>\n</div>\n<p>&quot;What then shall we say, that the law is sin? By no
    means! Yet if it had not been for the law I would not have known sin.&quot;</p>\n<p>And
    that feels to me a little bit like Paul saying what I've heard other Christians
    today say \u2014 something like:\n&quot;I didn't struggle with anger until I became
    a Christian and then it was a struggle!&quot;</p>\n<p>So there's that side of
    it.</p>\n<p>And then the other side of it is that God has &quot;written eternity
    on our hearts,&quot; has He not? And through Common Grace, do we not all understand
    very common morality?</p>\n<p>Aside from our worldviews, there are things that
    we know are wrong. Murdering is simply wrong. Another good example is something
    like cowardice\u2014or like Paul will go on to say, covetousness.</p>\n<p>Whether
    you're a Christian or not, you wouldn't value covetousness or cowardice. Cultures
    across the world and across history reject these things.</p>\n<p>So, through becoming
    a Christian, the struggle with sin really begins \u2014 because it's the understanding
    not that something is just kind of morally wrong, but that you're violating the
    law of the Creator of the universe.</p>\n<p>Now, we don't want to dive in so deep
    that we reject the context (of Paul's thoughts in Romans 7:7\u201313). And so,
    I don't want to dissect these few verses too much.</p>\n<p>And so what's my reflection?</p>\n<p>I
    don't know.</p>\n<p>Sin is crouching at the door.\nAnd it deceives me.\nSo, through
    the law, I learn what my sin is\u2014it lets me name my killer.</p>\n<p>The law
    didn't bring death\u2014it brings understanding of death, because it reveals sin,
    which produces death.</p>\n<p>But the part that I'm not &quot;to&quot; in my heart
    yet is the end of the passage. Verse 13:</p>\n<p>&quot;Did that which is good
    then (the law) bring death to me? By no means! It was sin producing death in me
    through what is good (the law), in order that sin might be shown to be sin and
    through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.&quot;</p>\n<p>And
    I think that that phrase &quot;sinful beyond measure&quot; is a reflection of
    Paul's understanding of sin in his life.</p>\n<p>Now, I claim I have the same
    mental understanding...</p>\n<p>Later on in Romans 7, Paul talks about his &quot;inner
    man&quot; and his mind being a slave to the law of the Spirit, but his body being
    a slave to sin.</p>\n<p>But can I really say that my mind is a slave to the law
    of the Spirit?</p>\n<p>I certainly would make a lot of theological points about
    it\u2014but is it really?</p>\n<p>That's my reflection this morning.</p>\n<p>I'm
    not as convicted over sin in my life, and so this reverse conscience searing needs
    to happen.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"another-reflection\">Another Reflection <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    for a second day, I believe by the guidance of the Spirit,\nI trust God to encourage
    and teach me through Paul's words</p>\n<p>How do I know what is sin (lawlessness)
    and what is not sin (ie. not lawless, ie. <em>lawful</em>)? It's through the law
    as noted above.</p>\n<p>What to do about this though? One day since some conviction
    settled into my heart certainly doesn't indicate anything about my life, but what
    else is relevant to this meditation?</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Psalm 1:1-2</p>\n<p>1 Blessed is the man who does not
    walk in the advice of the wicked;  nor does he stand in the way of sinners;  nor
    does he sit in the assembly of mockers.  2\_Instead, in the law of Yahweh is his
    delight,  and on his law he meditates day and night.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The &quot;law&quot;
    is <em>torah</em>... generally this is referring to a code of holy living.\nTorah
    isn't &quot;the law&quot; how we understand the law, it's case-law for holy living.\nTorah
    describes the flight of an arrow towards its target - it's the direction\nof your
    life.</p>\n<p>So the psalmist says that it's in the constant meditation of God's
    law (God's direction for holy living) that a man is &quot;blessed&quot;.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There's
    many words to use, but this word &quot;blessed&quot; is a Hebrew word used for
    when describing the good life of another person</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Blessed
    is the man who meditates on the law of Yahweh</li>\n<li>The law brings knowledge
    of sin</li>\n<li>Furthermore, the law causes sin to &quot;become sinful beyond
    measure&quot;</li>\n<li>How? Via the constant meditation of the law of Yahweh
    - which Psalm 1:3 says</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Psalm
    1:3</p>\n<p>3\_And so, he is like a tree planted by streams of water  that gives
    its fruit in its season;  its leaf also does not wither.  Therefore all that he
    does prospers.</p>\n</div>\n<p>Bible stuff is apart of my daily vocabulary with
    anyone. God's law is in my\nmind, and hopefully my heart, every day. At the same
    time, the callousness is\npresent. It's Paul's lament about being the chief of
    sinners, and about the war\nin his members (Romans 7/8)...</p>\n<p>The solution
    is this... day by day meditation - slightly more focused and\ndirected... God's
    blessing is absolutely on my lie - and the word for &quot;blessed&quot;\nin Psalm
    1 referring to <em>others</em> describing the life of the blessed man as\nblessed
    is very true for me - people around me know God's been good to me. So I\nhave
    every bit of faith that he will continue that goodness, and thankfully\nconviction
    this morning and week to take small steps towards a more devoted\nlife to the
    meditation of God's law.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 id=\"round-3\">Round 3 <a class=\"header-anchor\"

    well as it's one of the places we get the image and\nphrase of &quot;setting the

    class=\"admonition warning\">\n<p>This isn't a reflection or study of Isaiah 61
    - just a few notes as they pertain to my reflection on Romans 7 and 8 and the
    posture I have towards sin in my life</p>\n</div>\n<p>This is a messianic prophecy
    delivered to the people of God in captivity to\nspur the remnant of the faithful
    to continue hoping in the promises of Yahweh.</p>\n<p>Israel was in captivity
    more or less as discipline for violating God's word\npretty regularly... Consistent
    with my reflection so far - has &quot;sin become sin\nbeyond measure&quot; to
    me yet? No, just as it wasn't for Israel, and God allowed\nHis people to be enslaved
    multiple times as they turned to foreign gods... is\ncallousness to sin any different
    than turning to a foreign god? No, it's\nexactly what it is.</p>\n<p>But thankfully
    the over-arching story is about Yahweh's faithfulness to His\npeople, and this
    prophecy is for those who exercise faithfulness to Yahweh....\nthat's the crux
    of my reflection on Romans 7, how can I claim the promises of\nGod if sin is so
    present in my life? I think the answer is that it's only\nthrough the awakening
    of the Spirit that I can genuinely question my loyalty to\nYahweh and also acknowledge
    his loyalty to the Promise He brought me into. By\nGod's grace I'm just a guy
    who the Lord has grace on, and I pray through daily\nmeditation my will becomes
    so conformed to the will of Jesus that I can\nfaithfully say &quot;sin has become

    the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.</p>\n</div>\n<p>This morning
    I don't know if it was another translation or the direct explicit\nwork of the
    Spirit but I feel like something clicked just a little bit here.\nThe law didn't
    bring sin (lawlessness), God's law pre-exists Torah (Genesis,\nthe trees), so
    the law says what is good and bad, and it's the brokenness of\nhumanity (sin)
    producing death in us/me and the production of death shows sin\nto be what it
    is - sinful beyond measure</p>\n<p>So as I reflect here on Paul, Romans, and myself
    - what am I missing or what is\nGod recovering in me? This week has been pretty
    good concerning the areas of my\nmind and life where I feel callous and hardened.
    The daily meditation can't NOT\nbe the reason - devotion in the morning, however
    minimal and before anything else,\nis producing in me the will to do God's good
    work in my own life. I don't mean\ngiving money and doing charity - but in the
    privacy of my mind and day, do I\nhonor the Lord with every thought?</p>\n<p>The
    cliche but honest answer is no but I feel God's working in my heart, the\ntug
    towards Heaven and away from the hellish pit of my own desires</p>\n<hr />\n<h2

    snake is the embodiment of sin, and so we're not so concerned with the ontological
    origins of sin, but rather with processing its effect and consequences in our
    daily life.\nAnd so that first perspective is to say that - for me, by God's grace,
    I know the law.\nIt means that by God's grace, sin has the opportunity to produce
    <strong>things</strong> in me, and in that same breath of grace -\nJesus saves
    me.\nThat's the end of chapter seven.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p
    class=\"admonition-title\">Romans 7:24-25</p>\n<p>24 Wretched man that I am! Who
    will deliver me from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ
    our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh
    I serve the law of sin.</p>\n</div>\n<p>The other perspective that I have on this
    right now is not inward looking, and so I don't want to harp on it and meditate
    much on other people.\nBut Christians certainly have internal (internal to the
    community of faith) conversations about the morality of non-Christians and what
    should be expected of non-believers.\nAs far as a moral life is concerned and
    there's various theological opinions and various worldviews, even within Christianity
    through which we can filter reality and people's actions and their moralities.\nAnd
    so in that vein, perhaps something I see here is to read it almost backwards (transposed
    is a better word),</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>sin lies dead apart from the law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And
    you think, I think, about our culture's hedonistic posture towards being a slave
    to our own desires.\nAmerican culture largely celebrates, or Western culture rather,
    largely celebrates the individual decision to do what the individual wants.\nAnd
    we live in a culture where to shame others is itself shamed.\nIt is unacceptable
    to call people to higher standards of living.\nBut why should we (Christians)
    be surprised and why is this news and why do Christians spend time talking about
    it?\nI think Paul gives us the answer.\n&quot;Apart from the law&quot; (and the
    law is the direction in which we strive for holiness)\nAnd so &quot;apart from
    that, sin lies dead&quot; meaning sin doesn't seize an opportunity through any
    commandment.\nBecause apart from the law sin can't be shown to be sinfulness.\nThat's
    verse 13.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">Romans
    7:13</p>\n<p>13 Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no\nmeans!
    It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that\nsin might
    be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful\nbeyond measure.</p>\n</div>\n<p>So
    that last thought, it isn't so much that non-believers don't have the knowledge
    of good and bad.\nThe Bible says that God has written eternity on our hearts.\nAnd
    we have moral discussions in the public square all the time, so people\ncertainly
    are aware of opinions about morality, and it is in the rebellion\nagainst the
    good and moral positions where I'm right now actually finding\nsecurity in <strong>my</strong>
    position as a <strong>chosen child of God</strong> because honestly, I love debauchery,
    but (thankfully)\npart of me hates it, and it's that part of me that hates it,
    that is the Spirit\nin me, that is the grace of the Lord Jesus, saving me from

    on Romans 7:7-13\npublished: True\ntags:\n  - reflections\n  - faith\ncover: \"https://cdn.statically.io/gh/pypeaday/images.pype.dev/main/blog-media/20250818121110_25708203.png\"\n---\n\n##
    Passage\n\nRomans 7:7\u20137:13 (ESV): 7 What then shall we say? That the law
    is sin? By no\nmeans! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known
    sin. For I\nwould not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said,
    \u201CYou shall\nnot covet.\u201D 8 But sin, seizing an opportunity through the
    commandment, produced\nin me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law,
    sin lies dead. 9 I was\nonce alive apart from the law, but when the commandment
    came, sin came alive\nand I died. 10 The very commandment that promised life proved
    to be death to\nme. 11 For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment,
    deceived me and\nthrough it killed me. 12 So the law is holy, and the commandment
    is holy and\nrighteous and good. 13 Did that which is good, then, bring death
    to me? By no\nmeans! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in
    order that\nsin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become
    sinful\nbeyond measure. \n\n## Reflection\n\nAs I was dimwittedly working through
    1 John 3 for\n[[olivet-mens-group-august-2025]] I found myself gravitating towards
    Romans 7\nand 8 as it brings clarity to John's words about practicing sin vs being
    a\nchild of God.\n\n???+ note \"Personal\"\n\n    God's been good to me as I have
    started trying to be more focused in\n    theological study and reflection...
    It has been long enough for my \"break\" to\n    be over\n\nIt goes without saying
    in Christian circles that Romans is a tough cookie...\nPaul packs a lot in the
    letter and although I'm focusing right now on 7 verses,\nthe context certainly
    matters when it comes to deeper study. As for me this\nmorning I believe God's
    calling me to reverse-sear my conscience in regards to\nsome persistent sins in
    my life. I write a little note in my notes for the olivet study:\n\n> As I write
    this out, the Christian concept of \"setting the captives free\" and\njubilee
    and freedom strike my heart deeply. Just these phrases begin to call up\nemotions.
    But as I look at my life right now, what am I doing that shouts\nfreedom? I spend
    more time lately playing games than being entrenched in\ntheological study, I
    think about work more than things which are noble and\npraiseworthy, and I seem
    to purposefully focus on my own situations internally\nrather than on God's grace
    (which I do externally a lot - but I feel this\ntension inside - __a hook of doubt__)\n\nThese
    aren't the motifs in the passage, but the conversation around sin in our\nhearts
    spiderwebs throughout scripture very quickly if the conversation is to\nbe worth
    anything... Freedom is core in a Christian worldview, but am I free\nand devoted
    to Jesus or a morally bankrupt slave to myself?\n\nSo far I haven't even touched
    the passage so let me dive in a bit.\n\n???+ note \"\"\n\n    The rest of this
    post was dictated and transcribed via a STT utility I have at home. I often do
    this and rework my thoughts but here it's easier to word vomit the ideas and hope
    they make sense on the other side. I loosely edited it for readability but for
    whatever it's worth, this is moreso my thinking voice than my public speaking
    voice\n\n\"What then shall we say, that the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it
    had not been for the law I would not have known sin.\"\n\nAnd that feels to me
    a little bit like Paul saying what I've heard other Christians today say \u2014
    something like:\n\"I didn't struggle with anger until I became a Christian and
    then it was a struggle!\"\n\nSo there's that side of it.\n\nAnd then the other
    side of it is that God has \"written eternity on our hearts,\" has He not? And
    through Common Grace, do we not all understand very common morality?\n\nAside
    from our worldviews, there are things that we know are wrong. Murdering is simply
    wrong. Another good example is something like cowardice\u2014or like Paul will
    go on to say, covetousness.\n\nWhether you're a Christian or not, you wouldn't
    value covetousness or cowardice. Cultures across the world and across history
    reject these things.\n\nSo, through becoming a Christian, the struggle with sin
    really begins \u2014 because it's the understanding not that something is just
    kind of morally wrong, but that you're violating the law of the Creator of the
    universe.\n\nNow, we don't want to dive in so deep that we reject the context
    (of Paul's thoughts in Romans 7:7\u201313). And so, I don't want to dissect these
    few verses too much.\n\nAnd so what's my reflection?\n\nI don't know.\n\nSin is
    crouching at the door.\nAnd it deceives me.\nSo, through the law, I learn what
    my sin is\u2014it lets me name my killer.\n\nThe law didn't bring death\u2014it
    brings understanding of death, because it reveals sin, which produces death.\n\nBut
    the part that I'm not \"to\" in my heart yet is the end of the passage. Verse
    13:\n\n\"Did that which is good then (the law) bring death to me? By no means!
    It was sin producing death in me through what is good (the law), in order that
    sin might be shown to be sin and through the commandment might become sinful beyond
    measure.\"\n\nAnd I think that that phrase \"sinful beyond measure\" is a reflection
    of Paul's understanding of sin in his life.\n\nNow, I claim I have the same mental
    understanding...\n\nLater on in Romans 7, Paul talks about his \"inner man\" and
    his mind being a slave to the law of the Spirit, but his body being a slave to
    sin.\n\nBut can I really say that my mind is a slave to the law of the Spirit?\n\nI
    certainly would make a lot of theological points about it\u2014but is it really?\n\nThat's
    my reflection this morning.\n\nI'm not as convicted over sin in my life, and so
    this reverse conscience searing needs to happen.\n\n---\n\n## Another Reflection\n\nAs
    I come back here for a second day, I believe by the guidance of the Spirit,\nI
    trust God to encourage and teach me through Paul's words\n\nHow do I know what
    is sin (lawlessness) and what is not sin (ie. not lawless, ie. _lawful_)? It's
    through the law as noted above. \n\nWhat to do about this though? One day since
    some conviction settled into my heart certainly doesn't indicate anything about
    my life, but what else is relevant to this meditation?\n\n!!! note \"Psalm 1:1-2\"
    \n\n    1 Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of the wicked;  nor
    does he stand in the way of sinners;  nor does he sit in the assembly of mockers.
    \ 2\_Instead, in the law of Yahweh is his delight,  and on his law he meditates
    day and night.  \n\nThe \"law\" is _torah_... generally this is referring to a
    code of holy living.\nTorah isn't \"the law\" how we understand the law, it's
    case-law for holy living.\nTorah describes the flight of an arrow towards its
    target - it's the direction\nof your life. \n\nSo the psalmist says that it's
    in the constant meditation of God's law (God's direction for holy living) that
    a man is \"blessed\". \n\n> There's many words to use, but this word \"blessed\"
    is a Hebrew word used for when describing the good life of another person\n\n-
    Blessed is the man who meditates on the law of Yahweh\n- The law brings knowledge
    of sin\n- Furthermore, the law causes sin to \"become sinful beyond measure\"\n-
    How? Via the constant meditation of the law of Yahweh - which Psalm 1:3 says\n\n!!!
    note \"Psalm 1:3\" \n\n    3\_And so, he is like a tree planted by streams of
    water  that gives its fruit in its season;  its leaf also does not wither.  Therefore
    all that he does prospers.  \n\nBible stuff is apart of my daily vocabulary with
    anyone. God's law is in my\nmind, and hopefully my heart, every day. At the same
    time, the callousness is\npresent. It's Paul's lament about being the chief of
    sinners, and about the war\nin his members (Romans 7/8)... \n\nThe solution is
    this... day by day meditation - slightly more focused and\ndirected... God's blessing
    is absolutely on my lie - and the word for \"blessed\"\nin Psalm 1 referring to
    _others_ describing the life of the blessed man as\nblessed is very true for me
    - people around me know God's been good to me. So I\nhave every bit of faith that
    he will continue that goodness, and thankfully\nconviction this morning and week
    to take small steps towards a more devoted\nlife to the meditation of God's law.\n\n---\n\n##
    Round 3\n\nToday the Bible Project app brought me to Isaiah 61 which coincides
    with this\nextended reflection quite well as it's one of the places we get the
    image and\nphrase of \"setting the captives free\" which is a Biblical theme I
    see Paul\nleaning on at the end of Romans 7.\n\n!!! note \"Isaiah 61\"\n\n    1
    The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is upon me,\n    because Yahweh has anointed me,
    \ he has sent me to bring good news to the\n    oppressed,  to bind up the brokenhearted,
    \ to proclaim release to the captives\n    and liberation to those who are bound,
    \ \n    2\_to proclaim the year of Yahweh\u2019s\n    favor,  and our God\u2019s
    day of vengeance,  to comfort all those in mourning,\n    3\_to give for those
    in mourning in Zion,  to give them a head wrap instead of\n    ashes,  the oil
    of joy instead of mourning,  a garment of praise instead of a\n    faint spirit.
    \ And they will be called oaks of righteousness,  the planting of\n    Yahweh,
    to show his glory.  \n\n    4\_And they shall build the ancient ruins,  they\n
    \   shall erect the former deserted places.  And they shall restore the devastated\n
    \   cities,  the deserted places of many generations.  \n    5\_And strangers
    shall stand\n    and feed your flocks,  and foreigners shall be your farmers and
    vinedressers.\n    6\_But you shall be called the priests of Yahweh,  you will
    be called servers of\n    our God.  You shall eat the wealth of the nations,  and
    you shall boast in\n    their riches.  \n    7\_Instead of your shame, a double
    portion,  and instead of\n    insult, they will rejoice over their portion.  Therefore
    they will take a\n    double portion in their land;  they shall possess everlasting
    joy.  \n    8\_For I, Yahweh, love justice,  hate robbery and injustice,  and
    I will\n    faithfully give\n    their reward,  and I will make an everlasting
    covenant with them.  \n    9\_And their\n    descendants will be known among the
    nations,  and their offspring in the midst\n    of the peoples.  All those who
    see them shall recognize them,  that they are\n    descendants whom Yahweh has
    blessed.  \n\n    10\_I will rejoice greatly in Yahweh;  my\n    being shall shout
    in exultation in my God.  For he has clothed me with garments\n    of salvation,
    \ he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,  as a\n    bridegroom adorns
    himself with a head wrap like a priest,  and as a bride\n    adorns herself with
    her jewelry. \n    11\_For as the earth produces its sprout,  and\n    as a garden
    makes its plants sprout,  so the Lord Yahweh will make\n    righteousness sprout,
    \ and praise before all the nations.  \n\n!!! warning \"\"\n\n    This isn't a
    reflection or study of Isaiah 61 - just a few notes as they pertain to my reflection
    on Romans 7 and 8 and the posture I have towards sin in my life\n\nThis is a messianic
    prophecy delivered to the people of God in captivity to\nspur the remnant of the
    faithful to continue hoping in the promises of Yahweh.\n\nIsrael was in captivity
    more or less as discipline for violating God's word\npretty regularly... Consistent
    with my reflection so far - has \"sin become sin\nbeyond measure\" to me yet?
    No, just as it wasn't for Israel, and God allowed\nHis people to be enslaved multiple
    times as they turned to foreign gods... is\ncallousness to sin any different than
    turning to a foreign god? No, it's\nexactly what it is.\n\nBut thankfully the
    over-arching story is about Yahweh's faithfulness to His\npeople, and this prophecy
    is for those who exercise faithfulness to Yahweh....\nthat's the crux of my reflection
    on Romans 7, how can I claim the promises of\nGod if sin is so present in my life?
    I think the answer is that it's only\nthrough the awakening of the Spirit that
    I can genuinely question my loyalty to\nYahweh and also acknowledge his loyalty
    to the Promise He brought me into. By\nGod's grace I'm just a guy who the Lord
    has grace on, and I pray through daily\nmeditation my will becomes so conformed
    to the will of Jesus that I can\nfaithfully say \"sin has become beyond sin to
    me\"\n\nPraise God for Paul's words at the end of Romans 7\n\n!!! note \"Romans
    7:24-25\"\n\n    24 Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body
    of death? 25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself
    serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.\n\n---\n\n##
    Round 4\n\n!!! note \"Romans 7:13\"\n\n    13 Did that which is good, then, bring
    death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good,
    in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might
    become sinful beyond measure. \n\nThis morning I don't know if it was another
    translation or the direct explicit\nwork of the Spirit but I feel like something
    clicked just a little bit here.\nThe law didn't bring sin (lawlessness), God's
    law pre-exists Torah (Genesis,\nthe trees), so the law says what is good and bad,
    and it's the brokenness of\nhumanity (sin) producing death in us/me and the production
    of death shows sin\nto be what it is - sinful beyond measure\n\nSo as I reflect
    here on Paul, Romans, and myself - what am I missing or what is\nGod recovering
    in me? This week has been pretty good concerning the areas of my\nmind and life
    where I feel callous and hardened. The daily meditation can't NOT\nbe the reason
    - devotion in the morning, however minimal and before anything else,\nis producing
    in me the will to do God's good work in my own life. I don't mean\ngiving money
    and doing charity - but in the privacy of my mind and day, do I\nhonor the Lord
    with every thought?\n\nThe cliche but honest answer is no but I feel God's working
    in my heart, the\ntug towards Heaven and away from the hellish pit of my own desires\n\n---\n\n##
    Round 5\n\nVerse 8b \"For apart from the law, sin lies dead.\"\n\n> This reflection
    was done audibly and the transcription was modified slightly for this post\n\nI
    think there's quite a few interesting perspectives, maybe two that come to mind
    pretty quickly.\n\nFor context, the rest of the verse is \n\n!!! note \"Romanas
    7:8\"\n\n    but sin seizing an opportunity through the commandment produced in
    me all kinds of covetousness, for apart from the law, sin lies dead.\n\nSo the
    first observation is sin gets its life and its effect (effectual power) through
    the conduit of the law.\nAnd so the law says don't do X. That means we now have
    knowledge to not do X. \n\nAnd then it's like the existence of sin has to be presupposed
    because it's the very same sin as in Genesis three.\nGod's rule of the land said
    not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, and sin seizing the opportunity
    through that commandment produced in Eve all kinds of covetousness.\n\nBut it
    wasn't really __actually__ the command of God.\nIt was the snake.\nSo in that
    sense, depending on our interpretation of Genesis 3, which I will forego...\nThe
    snake is the embodiment of sin, and so we're not so concerned with the ontological
    origins of sin, but rather with processing its effect and consequences in our
    daily life.\nAnd so that first perspective is to say that - for me, by God's grace,
    I know the law.\nIt means that by God's grace, sin has the opportunity to produce
    __things__ in me, and in that same breath of grace -\nJesus saves me.\nThat's
    the end of chapter seven.\n\n!!! note \"Romans 7:24-25\"\n\n    24 Wretched man
    that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God through
    Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but
    with my flesh I serve the law of sin.\n\nThe other perspective that I have on
    this right now is not inward looking, and so I don't want to harp on it and meditate
    much on other people.\nBut Christians certainly have internal (internal to the
    community of faith) conversations about the morality of non-Christians and what
    should be expected of non-believers.\nAs far as a moral life is concerned and
    there's various theological opinions and various worldviews, even within Christianity
    through which we can filter reality and people's actions and their moralities.\nAnd
    so in that vein, perhaps something I see here is to read it almost backwards (transposed
    is a better word), \n\n> sin lies dead apart from the law.\n\nAnd you think, I
    think, about our culture's hedonistic posture towards being a slave to our own
    desires.\nAmerican culture largely celebrates, or Western culture rather, largely
    celebrates the individual decision to do what the individual wants.\nAnd we live
    in a culture where to shame others is itself shamed.\nIt is unacceptable to call
    people to higher standards of living.\nBut why should we (Christians) be surprised
    and why is this news and why do Christians spend time talking about it?\nI think
    Paul gives us the answer.\n\"Apart from the law\" (and the law is the direction
    in which we strive for holiness)\nAnd so \"apart from that, sin lies dead\" meaning
    sin doesn't seize an opportunity through any commandment.\nBecause apart from
    the law sin can't be shown to be sinfulness.\nThat's verse 13.\n\n!!! note \"Romans
    7:13\"\n\n    13 Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no\n    means!
    It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that\n    sin

    measure.\n\nSo that last thought, it isn't so much that non-believers don't have
    the knowledge of good and bad.\nThe Bible says that God has written eternity on
    our hearts.\nAnd we have moral discussions in the public square all the time,

    the good and moral positions where I'm right now actually finding\nsecurity in
    **my** position as a __chosen child of God__ because honestly, I love debauchery,
    but (thankfully)\npart of me hates it, and it's that part of me that hates it,

## Passage

Romans 7:7–7:13 (ESV): 7 What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no
means! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I
would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, “You shall
not covet.” 8 But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced
in me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin lies dead. 9 I was
once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive
and I died. 10 The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to
me. 11 For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and
through it killed me. 12 So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and
righteous and good. 13 Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no
means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that
sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful
beyond measure. 

## Reflection

As I was dimwittedly working through 1 John 3 for
[[olivet-mens-group-august-2025]] I found myself gravitating towards Romans 7
and 8 as it brings clarity to John's words about practicing sin vs being a
child of God.

???+ note "Personal"

    God's been good to me as I have started trying to be more focused in
    theological study and reflection... It has been long enough for my "break" to
    be over

It goes without saying in Christian circles that Romans is a tough cookie...
Paul packs a lot in the letter and although I'm focusing right now on 7 verses,
the context certainly matters when it comes to deeper study. As for me this
morning I believe God's calling me to reverse-sear my conscience in regards to
some persistent sins in my life. I write a little note in my notes for the olivet study:

> As I write this out, the Christian concept of "setting the captives free" and
jubilee and freedom strike my heart deeply. Just these phrases begin to call up
emotions. But as I look at my life right now, what am I doing that shouts
freedom? I spend more time lately playing games than being entrenched in
theological study, I think about work more than things which are noble and
praiseworthy, and I seem to purposefully focus on my own situations internally
rather than on God's grace (which I do externally a lot - but I feel this
tension inside - __a hook of doubt__)

These aren't the motifs in the passage, but the conversation around sin in our
hearts spiderwebs throughout scripture very quickly if the conversation is to
be worth anything... Freedom is core in a Christian worldview, but am I free
and devoted to Jesus or a morally bankrupt slave to myself?

So far I haven't even touched the passage so let me dive in a bit.

???+ note ""

    The rest of this post was dictated and transcribed via a STT utility I have at home. I often do this and rework my thoughts but here it's easier to word vomit the ideas and hope they make sense on the other side. I loosely edited it for readability but for whatever it's worth, this is moreso my thinking voice than my public speaking voice

"What then shall we say, that the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law I would not have known sin."

And that feels to me a little bit like Paul saying what I've heard other Christians today say — something like:
"I didn't struggle with anger until I became a Christian and then it was a struggle!"

So there's that side of it.

And then the other side of it is that God has "written eternity on our hearts," has He not? And through Common Grace, do we not all understand very common morality?

Aside from our worldviews, there are things that we know are wrong. Murdering is simply wrong. Another good example is something like cowardice—or like Paul will go on to say, covetousness.

Whether you're a Christian or not, you wouldn't value covetousness or cowardice. Cultures across the world and across history reject these things.

So, through becoming a Christian, the struggle with sin really begins — because it's the understanding not that something is just kind of morally wrong, but that you're violating the law of the Creator of the universe.

Now, we don't want to dive in so deep that we reject the context (of Paul's thoughts in Romans 7:7–13). And so, I don't want to dissect these few verses too much.

And so what's my reflection?

I don't know.

Sin is crouching at the door.
And it deceives me.
So, through the law, I learn what my sin is—it lets me name my killer.

The law didn't bring death—it brings understanding of death, because it reveals sin, which produces death.

But the part that I'm not "to" in my heart yet is the end of the passage. Verse 13:

"Did that which is good then (the law) bring death to me? By no means! It was sin producing death in me through what is good (the law), in order that sin might be shown to be sin and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure."

And I think that that phrase "sinful beyond measure" is a reflection of Paul's understanding of sin in his life.

Now, I claim I have the same mental understanding...

Later on in Romans 7, Paul talks about his "inner man" and his mind being a slave to the law of the Spirit, but his body being a slave to sin.

But can I really say that my mind is a slave to the law of the Spirit?

I certainly would make a lot of theological points about it—but is it really?

That's my reflection this morning.

I'm not as convicted over sin in my life, and so this reverse conscience searing needs to happen.

---

## Another Reflection

As I come back here for a second day, I believe by the guidance of the Spirit,
I trust God to encourage and teach me through Paul's words

How do I know what is sin (lawlessness) and what is not sin (ie. not lawless, ie. _lawful_)? It's through the law as noted above. 

What to do about this though? One day since some conviction settled into my heart certainly doesn't indicate anything about my life, but what else is relevant to this meditation?

!!! note "Psalm 1:1-2" 

    1 Blessed is the man who does not walk in the advice of the wicked;  nor does he stand in the way of sinners;  nor does he sit in the assembly of mockers.  2 Instead, in the law of Yahweh is his delight,  and on his law he meditates day and night.  

The "law" is _torah_... generally this is referring to a code of holy living.
Torah isn't "the law" how we understand the law, it's case-law for holy living.
Torah describes the flight of an arrow towards its target - it's the direction
of your life. 

So the psalmist says that it's in the constant meditation of God's law (God's direction for holy living) that a man is "blessed". 

> There's many words to use, but this word "blessed" is a Hebrew word used for when describing the good life of another person

- Blessed is the man who meditates on the law of Yahweh
- The law brings knowledge of sin
- Furthermore, the law causes sin to "become sinful beyond measure"
- How? Via the constant meditation of the law of Yahweh - which Psalm 1:3 says

!!! note "Psalm 1:3" 

    3 And so, he is like a tree planted by streams of water  that gives its fruit in its season;  its leaf also does not wither.  Therefore all that he does prospers.  

Bible stuff is apart of my daily vocabulary with anyone. God's law is in my
mind, and hopefully my heart, every day. At the same time, the callousness is
present. It's Paul's lament about being the chief of sinners, and about the war
in his members (Romans 7/8)... 

The solution is this... day by day meditation - slightly more focused and
directed... God's blessing is absolutely on my lie - and the word for "blessed"
in Psalm 1 referring to _others_ describing the life of the blessed man as
blessed is very true for me - people around me know God's been good to me. So I
have every bit of faith that he will continue that goodness, and thankfully
conviction this morning and week to take small steps towards a more devoted
life to the meditation of God's law.

## Round 3

Today the Bible Project app brought me to Isaiah 61 which coincides with this
extended reflection quite well as it's one of the places we get the image and
phrase of "setting the captives free" which is a Biblical theme I see Paul
leaning on at the end of Romans 7.

!!! note "Isaiah 61"

    1 The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is upon me,
    because Yahweh has anointed me,  he has sent me to bring good news to the
    oppressed,  to bind up the brokenhearted,  to proclaim release to the captives
    and liberation to those who are bound,  
    2 to proclaim the year of Yahweh’s
    favor,  and our God’s day of vengeance,  to comfort all those in mourning,
    3 to give for those in mourning in Zion,  to give them a head wrap instead of
    ashes,  the oil of joy instead of mourning,  a garment of praise instead of a
    faint spirit.  And they will be called oaks of righteousness,  the planting of
    Yahweh, to show his glory.  

    4 And they shall build the ancient ruins,  they
    shall erect the former deserted places.  And they shall restore the devastated
    cities,  the deserted places of many generations.  
    5 And strangers shall stand
    and feed your flocks,  and foreigners shall be your farmers and vinedressers.
    6 But you shall be called the priests of Yahweh,  you will be called servers of
    our God.  You shall eat the wealth of the nations,  and you shall boast in
    their riches.  
    7 Instead of your shame, a double portion,  and instead of
    insult, they will rejoice over their portion.  Therefore they will take a
    double portion in their land;  they shall possess everlasting joy.  
    8 For I, Yahweh, love justice,  hate robbery and injustice,  and I will
    faithfully give
    their reward,  and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.  
    9 And their
    descendants will be known among the nations,  and their offspring in the midst
    of the peoples.  All those who see them shall recognize them,  that they are
    descendants whom Yahweh has blessed.  

    10 I will rejoice greatly in Yahweh;  my
    being shall shout in exultation in my God.  For he has clothed me with garments
    of salvation,  he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,  as a
    bridegroom adorns himself with a head wrap like a priest,  and as a bride
    adorns herself with her jewelry. 
    11 For as the earth produces its sprout,  and
    as a garden makes its plants sprout,  so the Lord Yahweh will make
    righteousness sprout,  and praise before all the nations.  

!!! warning ""

    This isn't a reflection or study of Isaiah 61 - just a few notes as they pertain to my reflection on Romans 7 and 8 and the posture I have towards sin in my life

This is a messianic prophecy delivered to the people of God in captivity to
spur the remnant of the faithful to continue hoping in the promises of Yahweh.

Israel was in captivity more or less as discipline for violating God's word
pretty regularly... Consistent with my reflection so far - has "sin become sin
beyond measure" to me yet? No, just as it wasn't for Israel, and God allowed
His people to be enslaved multiple times as they turned to foreign gods... is
callousness to sin any different than turning to a foreign god? No, it's
exactly what it is.

But thankfully the over-arching story is about Yahweh's faithfulness to His
people, and this prophecy is for those who exercise faithfulness to Yahweh....
that's the crux of my reflection on Romans 7, how can I claim the promises of
God if sin is so present in my life? I think the answer is that it's only
through the awakening of the Spirit that I can genuinely question my loyalty to
Yahweh and also acknowledge his loyalty to the Promise He brought me into. By
God's grace I'm just a guy who the Lord has grace on, and I pray through daily
meditation my will becomes so conformed to the will of Jesus that I can
faithfully say "sin has become beyond sin to me"

Praise God for Paul's words at the end of Romans 7

!!! note "Romans 7:24-25"

    24 Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.

---

## Round 4

!!! note "Romans 7:13"

    13 Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure. 

This morning I don't know if it was another translation or the direct explicit
work of the Spirit but I feel like something clicked just a little bit here.
The law didn't bring sin (lawlessness), God's law pre-exists Torah (Genesis,
the trees), so the law says what is good and bad, and it's the brokenness of
humanity (sin) producing death in us/me and the production of death shows sin
to be what it is - sinful beyond measure

So as I reflect here on Paul, Romans, and myself - what am I missing or what is
God recovering in me? This week has been pretty good concerning the areas of my
mind and life where I feel callous and hardened. The daily meditation can't NOT
be the reason - devotion in the morning, however minimal and before anything else,
is producing in me the will to do God's good work in my own life. I don't mean
giving money and doing charity - but in the privacy of my mind and day, do I
honor the Lord with every thought?

The cliche but honest answer is no but I feel God's working in my heart, the
tug towards Heaven and away from the hellish pit of my own desires

---

## Round 5

Verse 8b "For apart from the law, sin lies dead."

> This reflection was done audibly and the transcription was modified slightly for this post

I think there's quite a few interesting perspectives, maybe two that come to mind pretty quickly.

For context, the rest of the verse is 

!!! note "Romanas 7:8"

    but sin seizing an opportunity through the commandment produced in me all kinds of covetousness, for apart from the law, sin lies dead.

So the first observation is sin gets its life and its effect (effectual power) through the conduit of the law.
And so the law says don't do X. That means we now have knowledge to not do X. 

And then it's like the existence of sin has to be presupposed because it's the very same sin as in Genesis three.
God's rule of the land said not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and bad, and sin seizing the opportunity through that commandment produced in Eve all kinds of covetousness.

But it wasn't really __actually__ the command of God.
It was the snake.
So in that sense, depending on our interpretation of Genesis 3, which I will forego...
The snake is the embodiment of sin, and so we're not so concerned with the ontological origins of sin, but rather with processing its effect and consequences in our daily life.
And so that first perspective is to say that - for me, by God's grace, I know the law.
It means that by God's grace, sin has the opportunity to produce __things__ in me, and in that same breath of grace -
Jesus saves me.
That's the end of chapter seven.

!!! note "Romans 7:24-25"

    24 Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? 25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.

The other perspective that I have on this right now is not inward looking, and so I don't want to harp on it and meditate much on other people.
But Christians certainly have internal (internal to the community of faith) conversations about the morality of non-Christians and what should be expected of non-believers.
As far as a moral life is concerned and there's various theological opinions and various worldviews, even within Christianity through which we can filter reality and people's actions and their moralities.
And so in that vein, perhaps something I see here is to read it almost backwards (transposed is a better word), 

> sin lies dead apart from the law.

And you think, I think, about our culture's hedonistic posture towards being a slave to our own desires.
American culture largely celebrates, or Western culture rather, largely celebrates the individual decision to do what the individual wants.
And we live in a culture where to shame others is itself shamed.
It is unacceptable to call people to higher standards of living.
But why should we (Christians) be surprised and why is this news and why do Christians spend time talking about it?
I think Paul gives us the answer.
"Apart from the law" (and the law is the direction in which we strive for holiness)
And so "apart from that, sin lies dead" meaning sin doesn't seize an opportunity through any commandment.
Because apart from the law sin can't be shown to be sinfulness.
That's verse 13.

!!! note "Romans 7:13"

    13 Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no
    means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that
    sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful
    beyond measure.

So that last thought, it isn't so much that non-believers don't have the knowledge of good and bad.
The Bible says that God has written eternity on our hearts.
And we have moral discussions in the public square all the time, so people
certainly are aware of opinions about morality, and it is in the rebellion
against the good and moral positions where I'm right now actually finding
security in **my** position as a __chosen child of God__ because honestly, I love debauchery, but (thankfully)
part of me hates it, and it's that part of me that hates it, that is the Spirit
