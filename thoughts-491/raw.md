I often max my swap on all my machines, and I still have no idea what I'm dong different than anyone else. But using `top` I guess it's easy to see swap usage by process after adding it to the menu by hitting `f`, finding `SWAP`, then hit `space` and the right arrow key to move it to a convenient spot in the column order... Helped me see that I had 1 python process using over a full GeeBee of swap today!
