content: "# A Question\n\nWhat does it mean to be \"faithful\"? I wrestle with this
  question in various\ncontexts pretty regularly - mostly because God has been so
  ridiculously stupid\ngood to me that I feel compelled to ask daily \"am I being
  faithful with the\ngifts God has given me?\"\n\nThere's a lot of places to go from
  this starting point, but there's some events\nhappening in my life that are giving
  me perspective on Jesus' faithfulness to\nthe Father's will and what it implies
  for my own life of faithfulness and\nsteadfastness to the Lord.\n\n## Faithfulness\n\nHow
  do I be more like Jesus (as a human), and how do I more or less copy his\nfaithfulness
  to God in the wake of trial. I've certainly given some amount of\nthought to my
  own ability to be faithful in the worst potential circumstance of\nstraight up physical
  execution: martyrdom... In Fox's Book of Martyrs there's\naccounts of Christians
  through the ages singing hymns while being\nburned alive for their faith... What
  leads to that kind of faithfulness? What\ngave these heros of the faith the peace
  to face death with a song? Would\nI, today right now, if I was going to be executed
  for my faith (real reality in\nmany parts of the world) would I sing \"Amazing Grace\"
  while my physical body\nwas tortured to death... I can't say I know the answer to
  this, but the\naccounts of these martyrs is at least encouraging that God has developed
  the\nfaith of others to such a degree that physical torture cannot break them from\ntheir
  communion with God.\n\n!!! note \"What about NOT death...\"\n    \n    We all face
  trials of different kinds every day, and in the face of those trials what does faithfulness
  look like?\n\n## Knowledge\n\nBack to Jesus for a second... A confession of mine
  is that I've lowkey felt\nlike Jesus, as truly human, had a leg up on us when it
  comes to remaining\nfaithful to the Father's will.... \n\nAs a human he walked through
  life in deep communion\nwith the Father, and he _knows_ his place as the Author
  of creation, the one\nwho holds all things together. So I've often struggled with
  the thought \"of\ncourse Jesus is calm in X or isn't worried about Y... He knows
  he's God, he\nknows the plan, and that _knowledge_ must do something for enabling
  the kind\nof calm faith we see in the person, in the human, Jesus Christ.\"\n\n!!!
  waring \"\"\n\n    Jesus _knows_ that if he commanded a mountain to cast itself
  into the sea, that it would... So did Jesus have _faith_ or _knowledge_?\n\n## Almost
  There\n\nI think he had both, and part of living a life of faith is _remembering_
  all the\nthings that are true about Jesus... If I only say he's faithful and good
  to me\nbecause the Bible says so, well that's not a lot for me as a real physical\nperson
  to live my life on... I live my life based on experience like anyone\nelse, and
  experience gives anyone a unique kind of knowledge - it's more than\nreading something
  in a book, when you learn something by living through it the\nmessage is deeply
  engrained, it passes through your brain and into your\nbeing... ya know what I'm
  saying? There's things we know and then there's\nthings _we KNOW_. \n\nBut for this
  to happen we have to acknowledge God through it\nall... whatever \"it all\" is certainly
  affects what \"acknowledge God\" means, but\nfor Jesus he certainly gave God the
  Father every ounce of glory and credit\nduring his life, and that acknowledgement
  I believe is a part of Jesus' life of\nFaith... so too in my life do I try to practice
  this perspective - giving\nthanks to God for all things given and taken away...
  This acknowledgement\npresses the truth about God's goodness and faithfulness to
  me deeper and deeper\ninto my being. It is Jesus being tender to my heart and shepherding
  me into\nbeing more like him\n\nJesus _knew_ everything true about his power because
  of his experience and\nidentity. I would certainly claim to know it as well - but
  _my_ knowledge of\nJesus' power is not _his_ knowledge of his own power. So does
  any knowledge I\nhave or lack affect the reality of Jesus' faithfulness?\n\n!!!
  danger \"no...\"\n\n## The Point\n\nThis is finally my point... I'm going through
  a trial, losing something\nimportant to me that's valuable and a source of provision
  for my family in many\nways. But at the same time... God has been so good to me,
  and I have so much\nexperience and knowledge of that goodness... I've been complimented
  by a few\npeople in this situation about how I'm handling it - cause anyone would
  be\npretty justified in being angry in what I'm walking through... And I'm\nstruggling
  with many emotions:\n\n!!! note \"but ultimately\"\n\n    I know God provides for
  me\n\nand losing a massive source of that provision isn't the end of the world because\nnot
  only do I know that God provides for me, but he already has provided in\nsuch a
  way that this trial isn't devastating. It's annoying of course, but his\ngoodness
  to me so outshines the crappiness of this situation that I can't help\nbut overflow
  with \"this sucks but God's stil good, and has been and will be\". \n\nThe thing
  is that the people around me do not have all the same _knowledge_ as\nme that I've
  gained through _experience_ and acknowledgment of God's\ngoodness... Few people
  see all the details of how God has and is protecting me\nand my family that to the
  outsider of my life, witnessing what's happening, I\nmight look like that martyr
  being burned alive.... Of course that's a little\nhyperbolic, but I don't know the
  lives of all those martyrs - God probably\nworked in them for so long and in such
  deep ways that not only the reality of a\ntrial, but the reality of physical pain,
  just washes over them... \n\n!!! note \"That's how I feel\"\n\n    my trial here
  sucks, I even want to complain about it (and will probably) but ultimately God is
  so good to me, and I'll make that known to everyone around me. \n\nIt might look
  miraculous to them, and it doesn't mean it's\nnot, because it's God who provided
  for me in the first place, but my place of\nserenity in the wake of trial comes
  from Jesus pressing the reality of his\nfaithfulness into my life, and now that
  I have a backdrop of years of goodness\nfrom him - how can any one silly trial in
  this life send me anywhere but closer\nto my Heavenly Father as I trust him for
  provision."

    Jesus (as a human), and how do I more or less copy his\nfaithfulness to God in
    the wake of trial. I've certainly given some amount of\nthought to my own ability
    to be faithful in the worst potential circumstance of\nstraight up physical execution:
    martyrdom... In Fox's Book of Martyrs there's\naccounts of Christians through
    the ages singing hymns while being\nburned alive for their faith... What leads
    to that kind of faithfulness? What\ngave these heros of the faith the peace to
    face death with a song? Would\nI, today right now, if I was going to be executed
    for my faith (real reality in\nmany parts of the world) would I sing &quot;Amazing
    Grace&quot; while my physical body\nwas tortured to death... I can't say I know
    the answer to this, but the\naccounts of these martyrs is at least encouraging
    that God has developed the\nfaith of others to such a degree that physical torture
    cannot break them from\ntheir communion with God.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition

    human, had a leg up on us when it comes to remaining\nfaithful to the Father's
    will....</p>\n<p>As a human he walked through life in deep communion\nwith the
    Father, and he <em>knows</em> his place as the Author of creation, the one\nwho
    holds all things together. So I've often struggled with the thought &quot;of\ncourse
    Jesus is calm in X or isn't worried about Y... He knows he's God, he\nknows the
    plan, and that <em>knowledge</em> must do something for enabling the kind\nof

    and part of living a life of faith is <em>remembering</em> all the\nthings that
    are true about Jesus... If I only say he's faithful and good to me\nbecause the
    Bible says so, well that's not a lot for me as a real physical\nperson to live
    my life on... I live my life based on experience like anyone\nelse, and experience
    gives anyone a unique kind of knowledge - it's more than\nreading something in
    a book, when you learn something by living through it the\nmessage is deeply engrained,
    it passes through your brain and into your\nbeing... ya know what I'm saying?
    There's things we know and then there's\nthings <em>we KNOW</em>.</p>\n<p>But
    for this to happen we have to acknowledge God through it\nall... whatever &quot;it
    all&quot; is certainly affects what &quot;acknowledge God&quot; means, but\nfor
    Jesus he certainly gave God the Father every ounce of glory and credit\nduring
    his life, and that acknowledgement I believe is a part of Jesus' life of\nFaith...
    so too in my life do I try to practice this perspective - giving\nthanks to God
    for all things given and taken away... This acknowledgement\npresses the truth
    about God's goodness and faithfulness to me deeper and deeper\ninto my being.
    It is Jesus being tender to my heart and shepherding me into\nbeing more like
    him</p>\n<p>Jesus <em>knew</em> everything true about his power because of his
    experience and\nidentity. I would certainly claim to know it as well - but <em>my</em>
    knowledge of\nJesus' power is not <em>his</em> knowledge of his own power. So
    does any knowledge I\nhave or lack affect the reality of Jesus' faithfulness?</p>\n<div

    I'm going through a trial, losing something\nimportant to me that's valuable and
    a source of provision for my family in many\nways. But at the same time... God
    has been so good to me, and I have so much\nexperience and knowledge of that goodness...
    I've been complimented by a few\npeople in this situation about how I'm handling
    it - cause anyone would be\npretty justified in being angry in what I'm walking
    through... And I'm\nstruggling with many emotions:</p>\n<div class=\"admonition
    note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">but ultimately</p>\n<p>I know God provides
    for me</p>\n</div>\n<p>and losing a massive source of that provision isn't the
    end of the world because\nnot only do I know that God provides for me, but he
    already has provided in\nsuch a way that this trial isn't devastating. It's annoying
    of course, but his\ngoodness to me so outshines the crappiness of this situation
    that I can't help\nbut overflow with &quot;this sucks but God's stil good, and
    has been and will be&quot;.</p>\n<p>The thing is that the people around me do
    not have all the same <em>knowledge</em> as\nme that I've gained through <em>experience</em>
    and acknowledgment of God's\ngoodness... Few people see all the details of how
    God has and is protecting me\nand my family that to the outsider of my life, witnessing
    what's happening, I\nmight look like that martyr being burned alive.... Of course
    that's a little\nhyperbolic, but I don't know the lives of all those martyrs -
    God probably\nworked in them for so long and in such deep ways that not only the
    reality of a\ntrial, but the reality of physical pain, just washes over them...</p>\n<div
    class=\"admonition note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">That's how I feel</p>\n<p>my
    trial here sucks, I even want to complain about it (and will probably) but ultimately
    God is so good to me, and I'll make that known to everyone around me.</p>\n</div>\n<p>It
    might look miraculous to them, and it doesn't mean it's\nnot, because it's God
    who provided for me in the first place, but my place of\nserenity in the wake
    of trial comes from Jesus pressing the reality of his\nfaithfulness into my life,
    and now that I have a backdrop of years of goodness\nfrom him - how can any one
    silly trial in this life send me anywhere but closer\nto my Heavenly Father as
    I trust him for provision.</p>\n\n    </section>\n</article>        </div>\n    </main>\n\n</div>\n

    Jesus (as a human), and how do I more or less copy his\nfaithfulness to God in
    the wake of trial. I've certainly given some amount of\nthought to my own ability
    to be faithful in the worst potential circumstance of\nstraight up physical execution:
    martyrdom... In Fox's Book of Martyrs there's\naccounts of Christians through
    the ages singing hymns while being\nburned alive for their faith... What leads
    to that kind of faithfulness? What\ngave these heros of the faith the peace to
    face death with a song? Would\nI, today right now, if I was going to be executed
    for my faith (real reality in\nmany parts of the world) would I sing &quot;Amazing
    Grace&quot; while my physical body\nwas tortured to death... I can't say I know
    the answer to this, but the\naccounts of these martyrs is at least encouraging
    that God has developed the\nfaith of others to such a degree that physical torture
    cannot break them from\ntheir communion with God.</p>\n<div class=\"admonition

    and part of living a life of faith is <em>remembering</em> all the\nthings that
    are true about Jesus... If I only say he's faithful and good to me\nbecause the
    Bible says so, well that's not a lot for me as a real physical\nperson to live
    my life on... I live my life based on experience like anyone\nelse, and experience
    gives anyone a unique kind of knowledge - it's more than\nreading something in
    a book, when you learn something by living through it the\nmessage is deeply engrained,
    it passes through your brain and into your\nbeing... ya know what I'm saying?
    There's things we know and then there's\nthings <em>we KNOW</em>.</p>\n<p>But
    for this to happen we have to acknowledge God through it\nall... whatever &quot;it
    all&quot; is certainly affects what &quot;acknowledge God&quot; means, but\nfor
    Jesus he certainly gave God the Father every ounce of glory and credit\nduring
    his life, and that acknowledgement I believe is a part of Jesus' life of\nFaith...
    so too in my life do I try to practice this perspective - giving\nthanks to God
    for all things given and taken away... This acknowledgement\npresses the truth
    about God's goodness and faithfulness to me deeper and deeper\ninto my being.
    It is Jesus being tender to my heart and shepherding me into\nbeing more like
    him</p>\n<p>Jesus <em>knew</em> everything true about his power because of his
    experience and\nidentity. I would certainly claim to know it as well - but <em>my</em>
    knowledge of\nJesus' power is not <em>his</em> knowledge of his own power. So
    does any knowledge I\nhave or lack affect the reality of Jesus' faithfulness?</p>\n<div

    I'm going through a trial, losing something\nimportant to me that's valuable and
    a source of provision for my family in many\nways. But at the same time... God
    has been so good to me, and I have so much\nexperience and knowledge of that goodness...
    I've been complimented by a few\npeople in this situation about how I'm handling
    it - cause anyone would be\npretty justified in being angry in what I'm walking
    through... And I'm\nstruggling with many emotions:</p>\n<div class=\"admonition
    note\">\n<p class=\"admonition-title\">but ultimately</p>\n<p>I know God provides
    for me</p>\n</div>\n<p>and losing a massive source of that provision isn't the
    end of the world because\nnot only do I know that God provides for me, but he
    already has provided in\nsuch a way that this trial isn't devastating. It's annoying
    of course, but his\ngoodness to me so outshines the crappiness of this situation
    that I can't help\nbut overflow with &quot;this sucks but God's stil good, and
    has been and will be&quot;.</p>\n<p>The thing is that the people around me do
    not have all the same <em>knowledge</em> as\nme that I've gained through <em>experience</em>
    and acknowledgment of God's\ngoodness... Few people see all the details of how
    God has and is protecting me\nand my family that to the outsider of my life, witnessing
    what's happening, I\nmight look like that martyr being burned alive.... Of course
    that's a little\nhyperbolic, but I don't know the lives of all those martyrs -
    God probably\nworked in them for so long and in such deep ways that not only the
    reality of a\ntrial, but the reality of physical pain, just washes over them...</p>\n<div

    might look miraculous to them, and it doesn't mean it's\nnot, because it's God
    who provided for me in the first place, but my place of\nserenity in the wake
    of trial comes from Jesus pressing the reality of his\nfaithfulness into my life,
    and now that I have a backdrop of years of goodness\nfrom him - how can any one

# A Question

What does it mean to be "faithful"? I wrestle with this question in various
contexts pretty regularly - mostly because God has been so ridiculously stupid
good to me that I feel compelled to ask daily "am I being faithful with the
gifts God has given me?"

There's a lot of places to go from this starting point, but there's some events
happening in my life that are giving me perspective on Jesus' faithfulness to
the Father's will and what it implies for my own life of faithfulness and
steadfastness to the Lord.

## Faithfulness

How do I be more like Jesus (as a human), and how do I more or less copy his
faithfulness to God in the wake of trial. I've certainly given some amount of
thought to my own ability to be faithful in the worst potential circumstance of
straight up physical execution: martyrdom... In Fox's Book of Martyrs there's
accounts of Christians through the ages singing hymns while being
burned alive for their faith... What leads to that kind of faithfulness? What
gave these heros of the faith the peace to face death with a song? Would
I, today right now, if I was going to be executed for my faith (real reality in
many parts of the world) would I sing "Amazing Grace" while my physical body
was tortured to death... I can't say I know the answer to this, but the
accounts of these martyrs is at least encouraging that God has developed the
faith of others to such a degree that physical torture cannot break them from
their communion with God.

!!! note "What about NOT death..."
    
    We all face trials of different kinds every day, and in the face of those trials what does faithfulness look like?

## Knowledge

Back to Jesus for a second... A confession of mine is that I've lowkey felt
like Jesus, as truly human, had a leg up on us when it comes to remaining
faithful to the Father's will.... 

As a human he walked through life in deep communion
with the Father, and he _knows_ his place as the Author of creation, the one
who holds all things together. So I've often struggled with the thought "of
course Jesus is calm in X or isn't worried about Y... He knows he's God, he
knows the plan, and that _knowledge_ must do something for enabling the kind
of calm faith we see in the person, in the human, Jesus Christ."

!!! waring ""

    Jesus _knows_ that if he commanded a mountain to cast itself into the sea, that it would... So did Jesus have _faith_ or _knowledge_?

## Almost There

I think he had both, and part of living a life of faith is _remembering_ all the
things that are true about Jesus... If I only say he's faithful and good to me
because the Bible says so, well that's not a lot for me as a real physical
person to live my life on... I live my life based on experience like anyone
else, and experience gives anyone a unique kind of knowledge - it's more than
reading something in a book, when you learn something by living through it the
message is deeply engrained, it passes through your brain and into your
being... ya know what I'm saying? There's things we know and then there's
things _we KNOW_. 

But for this to happen we have to acknowledge God through it
all... whatever "it all" is certainly affects what "acknowledge God" means, but
for Jesus he certainly gave God the Father every ounce of glory and credit
during his life, and that acknowledgement I believe is a part of Jesus' life of
Faith... so too in my life do I try to practice this perspective - giving
thanks to God for all things given and taken away... This acknowledgement
presses the truth about God's goodness and faithfulness to me deeper and deeper
into my being. It is Jesus being tender to my heart and shepherding me into
being more like him

Jesus _knew_ everything true about his power because of his experience and
identity. I would certainly claim to know it as well - but _my_ knowledge of
Jesus' power is not _his_ knowledge of his own power. So does any knowledge I
have or lack affect the reality of Jesus' faithfulness?

## The Point

This is finally my point... I'm going through a trial, losing something
important to me that's valuable and a source of provision for my family in many
ways. But at the same time... God has been so good to me, and I have so much
experience and knowledge of that goodness... I've been complimented by a few
people in this situation about how I'm handling it - cause anyone would be
pretty justified in being angry in what I'm walking through... And I'm
struggling with many emotions:

!!! note "but ultimately"

    I know God provides for me

and losing a massive source of that provision isn't the end of the world because
not only do I know that God provides for me, but he already has provided in
such a way that this trial isn't devastating. It's annoying of course, but his
goodness to me so outshines the crappiness of this situation that I can't help
but overflow with "this sucks but God's stil good, and has been and will be". 

The thing is that the people around me do not have all the same _knowledge_ as
me that I've gained through _experience_ and acknowledgment of God's
goodness... Few people see all the details of how God has and is protecting me
and my family that to the outsider of my life, witnessing what's happening, I
might look like that martyr being burned alive.... Of course that's a little
hyperbolic, but I don't know the lives of all those martyrs - God probably
worked in them for so long and in such deep ways that not only the reality of a
trial, but the reality of physical pain, just washes over them... 

!!! note "That's how I feel"

    my trial here sucks, I even want to complain about it (and will probably) but ultimately God is so good to me, and I'll make that known to everyone around me. 

It might look miraculous to them, and it doesn't mean it's
not, because it's God who provided for me in the first place, but my place of
serenity in the wake of trial comes from Jesus pressing the reality of his
faithfulness into my life, and now that I have a backdrop of years of goodness
from him - how can any one silly trial in this life send me anywhere but closer
to my Heavenly Father as I trust him for provision.
