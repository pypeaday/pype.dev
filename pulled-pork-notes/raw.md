# June 26 2025

I smoked 2 pork shoulders

1. Heavy application of Jack Daniels default pork rub + Meat Church's the Holy Gospel
2. Hot Honey Ham + Perfect Pork (festival)

They smoked with Traegar's Signature pellets at 250 until internal temp of 205,
then they rest covered for a few hours, then tear apart...

overall rating:

The Hot Honey Ham + Perfect Pork tasted great. It was not that spicy at all,
good flavor. It ended up being a little dry but this was certainly cause of my
utter lack of attention while the meat is smoking

We ate the pulled pork today and it was a little dry, though very edible
nonetheless. I think I need to tend to the pork more with something like an
apple juice spray and then covering it in the latter part of the smoke...

As for quantity - 2 pork shoulders (and 1 beef arm roast that I smoked today)
easily fed 4 families (8 adults + 9 kids) and we have plenty left over... like
probably a full pork shoulder's worth, between all 3 meats.

## Notes

1. spicy pickles were a good addition
2. seriously need to tend to the pork more during the smoking, after a second re-heat it's getting pretty dry
