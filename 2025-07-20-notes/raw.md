## Today

- started [[you-suck-at-git-but-its-honestly-fine]]

- made great progress on protecting some markata posts with an encryption workflow
  - markata build can encrypt the rendered html data of a post (encryption done with python)
  - front-end can decrypt the post content
  - password and decrypted content are nowhere on the rendered website (but they are presently in the repo)
  - [[example-protected-post]] - password is `example123`
