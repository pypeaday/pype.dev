The idea is something like the AUR, which is ultimately a pointer to a repo with a script that does some setup...

Perhaps my [[homelab-as-a-service]] idea could have its own package manager or
repository of one-click type of applications. This could end up being basically
any amount of compose files or something with a simple front-end, which is kind
of what portainer does though I'm not fluent in its capabilities.
