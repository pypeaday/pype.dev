<p>Here's my thought on <a href="https://dbushell.com/notes/2025-06-22T06:11Z/">💭 Notes – 06:11 Sun 22 Jun 2025 – David Bushell – Web Dev (UK)</a></p>

<p>I see that most of the tech world, at least in public, leans left... which is fine. I think politically I'd have leaned left in the 90s/00s if I had been old enough to pay attention and understand.</p>
<p>But the sold-out hatred for Elon and Trump is wild to me... Nothing makes the reality of propganda in 2025 more clear to me than the manufactured hate of 2 guys who the Left USED to love... I'm not like all in on either guy - but the politically driven hatred which has led to physical violence against both of these guys is insane....</p>
<p>Dave's ending thought here &quot;We're entering a Misinformation Age&quot; is funny to me... Misinformation has been around forever - the CIA has admitted to an absolutely hilarious amount of things that over the years the government (US Government) had denied and the news had been complicit in covering up - right up until it was just undeniable and finally &quot;ok ya everyone we did do that mind control experiment - BUT WE'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN&quot;... &quot;ok ya everyone we did know the Taliban has been on the receiving end of millions of US dollars every year but don't worry about it&quot;... But for everyone to NOW get all up in arms over 2 guys the news will not shut up about, is just comically out of touch with history to me...</p>
