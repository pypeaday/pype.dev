I see that most of the tech world, at least in public, leans left... which is fine. I think politically I'd have leaned left in the 90s/00s if I had been old enough to pay attention and understand.

But the sold-out hatred for Elon and Trump is wild to me... Nothing makes the reality of propganda in 2025 more clear to me than the manufactured hate of 2 guys who the Left USED to love... I'm not like all in on either guy - but the politically driven hatred which has led to physical violence against both of these guys is insane.... 

Dave's ending thought here "We're entering a Misinformation Age" is funny to me... Misinformation has been around forever - the CIA has admitted to an absolutely hilarious amount of things that over the years the government (US Government) had denied and the news had been complicit in covering up - right up until it was just undeniable and finally "ok ya everyone we did do that mind control experiment - BUT WE'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN"... "ok ya everyone we did know the Taliban has been on the receiving end of millions of US dollars every year but don't worry about it"... But for everyone to NOW get all up in arms over 2 guys the news will not shut up about, is just comically out of touch with history to me...
