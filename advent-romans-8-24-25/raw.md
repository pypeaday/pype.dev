!!! note "Romans 8:24-25"

    24 For in hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope, for who hopes for what he sees? 25 But if we hope for what we do not see, we await it eagerly with patient endurance.

Q: What does it look like for you to actively but patiently wait for God right now?

"What does it look like" often causes me to think about hwo someone else might
observe my life in relation to the question. This comes up a lot in
theology/fellowship discussions "what does it look like for..." and then we
talk about practical things that humans can do that we can see with our eyes.

But in my faith journey, as I have seen God's faithfulness to me and my family,
my mind is not immediately going to outward looking things...

For example "What does it look like for Christians to live differently than
others?" and the answers are always the same "we love our enemies", "protestant
work ethic - Christians should work harder since we work for an audience of
One", "We don't cuss"... etc. Things that someone could conceivably witness and
then potentially draw the conclusion of the question (which is that Christians
ought to live differently than non-Christians)

So I see these 2 ways of thinking about the "what does it look like" question -
the outward observable perspective, but then an inward one

I guess outwardly, there are some answers where someone might
observe it and then conclude that I am waiting actively and patiently for the
Lord... Here are some examples:

1. Our Advent wreath on the dining table, anyone who enters out home will see
   it (as do I every day which reminds me of the active waiting)
2. This blog - anyone who finds my posts should no doubt observe that my life
   has been claimed by Jesus and I'm living my life to that end by his grace

But inwardly, in the secret... I think some reality is continuing to sink in
that is a byproduct of witnessing God's faithfulness to me... The way it looks
for me to actively but patiently wait on the Lord is to just walk day by day in
the life he's given me... It's a great life - beautiful family, decent work,
beyond decent compensation - in a lot of ways I'm living the American Dream and
God has been so good to me. My patience and activity I hope are not so much
manifested by my will but moreso may they be acts of trust in a God who has shown
himself worth trusting.

So, for me, "what does it look like?" is it looks like
trusting when I'm frustrated, it looks like breathing when circumstances aren't
what I wanted, and it looks like putting one foot in front of the other in
daily faithful life to Jesus...
